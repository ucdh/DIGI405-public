A rabbit attempts to play a church organ,
while a knight fights a giant snail
and a naked man blows a trumpet 
with his rear end.
Painted with squirrel-hair brushes 
on vellum or parchment
by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople,
these bizarre images populate the 
margins of the most prized books
from the Middle Ages.

Their illustrations often tell a second 
story as rich as the text itself.
Some images appear in many 
different illuminated manuscripts,
and often reinforce the religious 
content of the books they decorated.
For example, a porcupine picking 
up fruit on its spines
could represent the devil stealing 
the fruits of faith—
or Christ taking up the sins of mankind.
Medieval lore stated that a hunter 
could only capture a unicorn
when it lay its horn in 
the lap of a virgin,
so a unicorn could symbolize 
either sexual temptation
or Christ being captured by his enemies.
Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent 
human’s lustful natures—
and could redeem themselves through 
attempts to make sacred music
despite their failings.

All of these references would have 
been familiar to medieval Europeans
from other art forms and oral tradition,
though some have grown more 
mysterious over the centuries.
Today,
no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means—
or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing.
The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death,
which defeats even the strongest knights.
Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride.

Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts,
and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations.
The butt tuba, for example,
was likely shorthand to 
express disapproval with—
or add an ironic spin to—
the action in the text.

Illuminations could also be used to 
make subversive political commentary.
The text of the "Smithfield Decretals"
details the Church’s laws and 
punishments for lawbreakers.
But the margins show a fox being 
hanged by geese,
a possible allusion to the common people 
turning on their powerful oppressors.
In the "Chronica Majora,"
Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day,
in which the Welsh prince Griffin
plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London.
Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote,
while others thought he was pushed.
He added his own take in the margins,
which show the prince falling to his death
while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets.

Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature.
"The Luttrell Psalter,"
a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell,
shows a young woman having her hair done,
while a young man catches a bird in a net.
The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out,
indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties.
This alludes to a family scandal
where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth.
The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book
to remind his clients of their failings
and encourage their spiritual development.

Some artists even painted themselves 
into the manuscripts.
The opening image of Christine de 
Pisan’s collected works
shows de Pisan presenting 
the book to the Queen of France.
The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's 
previous work
that she commissioned her own copy.
Such royal patronage
enabled her to establish her own 
publishing house in Paris.

The tradition of illuminated manuscripts 
lasted for over a thousand years.
The books were created by individuals or 
teams for uses as wide-ranging
as private prayer aids, service books 
in churches, textbooks,
and protective talismans to 
take into battle.
Across all this variation,
those tricky little drawings 
in the margins
are a unique window into the 
minds of medieval artists.
