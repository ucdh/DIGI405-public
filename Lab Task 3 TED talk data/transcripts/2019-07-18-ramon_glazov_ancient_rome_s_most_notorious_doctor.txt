In the middle of the 16th century,
a talented young anatomist named Andreas
Vesalius made a shocking discovery:
the most famous human anatomy texts in 
the world were wrong.
They not only failed to account for many
details of the human body,
they also described the organs of apes
and other mammals.
While Vesalius knew he was right,
announcing these errors would mean
challenging Galen of Pergamon–
the most renowned physician 
in medical history.
But who was this towering figure?
And why did doctors working more than
1,300 years later so revere and fear him?

Born in 129 CE,
Galen left home as a teen to scour the
Mediterranean for medical wisdom.
He returned home a gifted surgeon with a
passion for anatomy
and a penchant for showmanship.
He gleefully entered public anatomy 
contests,
eager to show up his fellow physicians.
In one demonstration,
he caused a pig to lose its voice by tying
off one of its nerves.
In another, he disemboweled a monkey and
challenged his colleagues to repair it.
When they couldn’t, he did.
These grizzly feats won him a position as 
surgeon to the city’s gladiators.
Eventually, he would leave the arena 
to become the personal physician
to four Roman Emperors.

While his peers debated symptoms and 
their origins,
Galen obsessively studied anatomy.
He was convinced that each organ had a
specific function.
Since the Roman government largely 
prohibited working with human cadavers,
Galen conducted countless dissections 
of animals instead.
Even with this constraint,
his exhaustive investigations yielded 
some remarkably accurate conclusions.

One of Galen’s most important 
contributions
was the insight that the brain,
not the heart, controlled the body.
He confirmed this theory by opening the
cranium of a living cow.
By applying pressure to different 
parts of the brain,
he could link various regions 
to specific functions.
Other experiments allowed him to 
distinguish sensory from motor nerves,
establish that urine was 
made in the kidneys,
and deduce that respiration was 
controlled by muscles and nerves.

But these wild experiments also produced 
extraordinary misconceptions.
Galen never realized that blood cycles
continuously throughout the body.
Instead, he believed the liver constantly
produces an endless supply of blood,
which gets entirely depleted on its 
one-way trip to the organs.
Galen is also credited with solidifying 
the popular theory of the Four Humours.
Introduced by Hippocrates 
centuries earlier,
this misguided hypothesis attributed most
medical problems
to an imbalance in four bodily fluids 
called humours.
To correct the balance of these fluids, 
doctors employed dangerous treatments
like bloodletting and purging.
Informed by his poor understanding 
of the circulatory system,
Galen was a strong proponent 
of these treatments,
despite their sometimes lethal 
consequences.

Unfortunately, Galen’s ego 
drove him to believe that
all his discoveries were 
of the utmost importance.
He penned treatises on everything from
anatomy to nutrition to bedside manner,
meticulously cataloguing his writings 
to ensure their preservation.
Over the next 13 centuries,
Galen’s prolific collection dominated 
all other schools of medical thought.
His texts became the standard works 
taught to new generations of doctors,
who in turn, wrote new essays extolling 
Galen’s ideas.
Even doctors who actually dissected 
human cadavers
would bafflingly repeat Galen’s mistakes,
despite seeing clear evidence 
to the contrary.
Meanwhile, the few practitioners bold 
enough to offer conflicting opinions
were either ignored or ridiculed.

For 1,300 years, Galen’s legacy 
remained untouchable–
until renaissance anatomist Vesalius 
spoke out against him.
As a prominent scientist and lecturer,
his authority influenced many young 
doctors of his time.
But even then, it took another
hundred years
for an accurate description 
of blood flow to emerge,
and two hundred more for the theory 
of the Four Humours to fade.
Hopefully, today we can reap the benefits
of Galen’s experiments
without attributing equal credence 
to his less accurate ideas.
But perhaps just as valuable
is the reminder that science is an 
ever-evolving process,
which should always place 
evidence above ego.
