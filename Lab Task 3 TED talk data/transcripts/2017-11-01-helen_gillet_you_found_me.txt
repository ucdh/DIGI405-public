(Cello music starts)

You found me,

you found me

under a pile of broken memories

with your steady,

steady love.

You rocked me,

you rocked me,

you rocked me all through the night

with your steady,

steady love.

(Cello music continues)

(Taps rhythmically)

You found me,

you found me

under a pile of broken memories

with your steady,

your steady,

steady love.

And you rocked me,

you rocked me,

you rocked me all through the night

with your steady,

steady, steady love.

(Music ends)

(Applause)

Thank you.
