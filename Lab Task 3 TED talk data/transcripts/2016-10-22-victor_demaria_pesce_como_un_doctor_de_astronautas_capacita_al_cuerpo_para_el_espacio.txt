Do you remember when we were children,
when the adults
without fail, to show us
they were interested in us,
they would ask us the question:
"And you, what do you want
to be when you grow up?"
And in general, we said 
whatever came to our heads.
I wanted to be an astronaut.
But that didn't work out.
I ended up becoming a doctor,
a neurologist and a researcher.
And the question I always asked myself:
What are the limits of human adaptation
to extreme environments
such as high or low temperatures,
high heights, extreme depth,
even outer space?
As you can imagine,
I don't have any patients,
because you need to be in great health
to be able to face 
such an extreme environment.
This theme, became the research focus
that I have followed throughout 
my whole career in science.
My work place?
The European Astronaut Centre
of the European Space Agency.
Who are my patients? 
The team of European astronauts.
By the way, do you know that there are
astronauts in space right now?
Yes or no?
Yes!
Since 2001, there has been a permanent
presence of humans in space.
Six astronauts from various 
nationalities spend six months
in the International Space Station.
Every six months, there are three 
that come down and three that go up.
The last three actually just arrived 
yesterday to the ISS station.
The ISS, or what we call it,
the International Space Station,
is a grand scientific laboratory.
It it right here, 
in a "suburb" of the Earth.
It's is flying at 400 kilometers away
at a velocity of 17,400 mph.
The astronauts go 16 times around
the Earth in 24 hours.
At this velocity, instead of in 14 hours,
tomorrow I could go home 
to my house in Paris in 24 minutes.
It would be awesome!
(Laughter)
The astronauts —
Who are the astronauts?
They are professionals, 
high level technicians.
They are experimenters,
because they perform
the scientific experiments
that we doctors and researches design.
They are also the subjects
of our experiments,
because we do experiments on them.
The question that you will ask, 
of course is:
if the astronauts are all healthy, 
why do they need a doctor?
They actually do, because my work
within the research,
like those of my colleagues,
is to enable the astronauts to overcome
their fiscal physical 
and psychological problems
so they can live and work in space.
An environment for which 
evolution didn't prepare us.
On the Earth there are 
two fundamental factors;
the force of gravity
that has conditioned our entire anatomy,
the rotation of Earth and the way it 
alternates between light and darkness,
that has conditioned
all of our physiology.
The force of gravity 
has conditioned our anatomy
giving us our symmetrical body, 
more or less,
our sense of balance, 
the skeleton, our muscle mass,
all of this is conditioned by gravity
and the fight against it.
There is no gravity in space, 
so what will happen?
They will have balance problems, 
they will have decalcification.
The skeleton that's up there
will have a loss of muscle mass.
So...
we have designed a series
of physical exercises
with very precise protocols
which take into account all
of the sectors of the body,
so they can stay in shape.
Because, in addition, the astronauts
aren't weighed down,
so they stretch, growing about one inch.
And this produces pain.
Short people don't have expectations,
because when you return, you shrink —
(Laughter)
So, at this moment,
we are all working to ease
this type of pain,
creating a "super skin suit", that is 
the suit that the astronauts use here,
that we tried for the first time 
three months ago.
I was telling you about
the rotation of the Earth,
and the alternating day and night.
When this alternation is missing,
all of our physiology is affected.
And, of course, that together with 
all of the circadian rhythms
and all of the physiological variables.
From the first flights to space, 
we learned
that the astronauts didn't sleep well.
The quantity and quality were altered.
The body temperature as well.
Sleep, temperature, 
metabolism, nutrition —
because with all of these metabolic
changes that I was mentioning,
nutrition is affected.
Above all, the environment
of the space station,
with the long working hours
from 8 am to 10 pm,
so they can execute all of the protocols,
that we give them to do.
And also the constant 
noise of ventilation,
up to 60 to 70 decibels
to circulate the air.
The light that isn't that bright.
However, in 30 years of research,
we have been able to improve 
a few of the working conditions.
The simple things:
a comfortable sleeping bag,
which produces in space
the same pleasing sensation that we feel
when we go to lie down
and are between the sheets.
Also, the nutrition:
It's not only to cover nutritional
and metabolic needs —
because you have to be really
hungry to want to eat this —
(Laughter)
But also, to take well into account
the psychological aspect and the taste.
That's why the astronaut in red, 
Luca Parmitano,
who is a friend of mine,
brought to the station his Mom's lasagna,
to share with the entire crew.
That's a really special moment for them.
And we realized that we
as doctors and researchers,
have made some progress.
At this time, we are able
to enable astronauts
to live and work for 
a period of time in space
and bring them back to Earth,
all in all, in good health.
I see a lot of young people in this room,
that are very lucky because at this time,
we are starting a new era
in space exploration.
I told you that the Space Station
was in the suburbs.
We are returning to the Moon now, 
on our way to Mars.
Did you realize this?
Only 12 men have had the luck
to walk and work on the Moon
for a few hours or almost three days.
The highlight images that
you are seeing right now,
are not science fiction.
Our daily work at this time,
from what we are seeing 
is going to happen:
the first construction robots
will recover the lunar dust,
the regolith,
to build the first shelter —
starting in 2025.
After the first building is done,
three years after that, man will arrive.
First, for a few days.
And later, they will stay
for a few months.
This is very fast in the video —
it will take 3 months to do it.
There they will have their little house.
For us it is a huge challenge.
We have to anticipate
new training protocols
so the astronauts,
when they are walking on the Moon,
will be ready for anything 
that can happen.
We also have to have or engineer
health monitoring systems
to be able to check on them,
to detect any problems, 
and to be able to diagnose them.
And if a problem exists, we have
to intervene therapeutically,
without any doctor close by.
That is something very important to us.
And this trip to the Moon is
only the first chapter,
to continue on to Mars, the target.
Did you know?
After many years of working
in the space field,
at NASA and the European Space Agency,
I am starting to realize with
my colleges, that at this time,
we are facing the same type of problems
that our predecessors had,
the doctors for the Apollo program.
The Apollo program,
in my youth, like all of my generation,
we dreamed about this program.
And inevitably, this project to put
a man on the Moon, influenced
my choice and professional path.
And now this program is still relevant.
It's because of this, above all
for the young people,
I want to tell you that I really hope
that you can dream 
and that you can live by it.
In this short time 
that I was here with you,
I hope that I have passed on a little
of my enthusiasm and passion.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
