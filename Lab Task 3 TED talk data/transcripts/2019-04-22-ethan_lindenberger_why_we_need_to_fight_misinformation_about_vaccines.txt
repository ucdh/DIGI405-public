To start, I want to share with you guys
something about my hometown
of Norwalk, Ohio.
Now, as this video stated,
I am from Norwalk,
which is an extremely small town,
about 15,000 people.
And really, in Norwalk,
if you want to do something fun,
you go to Walmart or drive half an hour
to something more interesting.
And for Norwalk, I've lived there
for my entire life,
I'm a senior at the local
public high school,
and you know, it's something
to where I really enjoy my small town.
And I'm just a normal kid, you know,
I lead debate clubs,
I volunteer at my church.

And back in November of 2018,
I made a small Reddit post
asking for advice
on an issue that I was encountering
that I needed some clarification on.
And this issue, as was stated
in the introduction,
was something towards vaccinations
and how I was not immunized
against various diseases,
including polio and measles,
as well as influenza, HPV, hepatitis —
the standard vaccine
someone my age would receive.
Now, this question I asked
was simple and pretty strange,
because, you know,
I wanted to get vaccinated.
That's kind of weird, but it happened,
and then this turned into a public story,
because I wanted to get vaccinated.
So that was kind of strange,
and then it blew up more,
and I was doing interviews
and talking to more people,
and again, I'm a normal kid,
I'm not a scientist,
I don't lead a non-profit,
I am a pretty casual person,
I'm wearing a hoodie.

(Laughter)

Because of this question and this story,
because I wanted to get vaccinated
and this interesting situation I was in,
I saw that I quickly was
in this public setting
of an extremely important controversy
and discussion taking place.
Now, I saw that the stories and headlines
were pretty accurate for most part,
you know, "After defying anti-vax mom,
Ohio teen expresses
why he got vaccinated."
Pretty accurate, pretty true.
And, as stated, I testified
in front of a Senate committee,
so there, they said,
"This teen who self-vaccinated
just ripped his mom's anti-vaxer beliefs
in front of Congress."
OK, I didn't really do that,
but that's fine.
And certain news outlets
took it a little further.
"'God knows how I'm still alive':
Teenager, 18, finally gets vaccinated
and attacks his anti-vax parents."

So I did not attack my parents,
that's not accurate at all.
And you know, really,
my story was more about controversy.
It was about how my mom
was bad and I was good,
and I was ripping her a new one.
Not true.
Not what was happening.
I never was rude towards my mother,
and even in public settings
where I expressed
how her beliefs were misinformed,
I said that she was a loving mother,
and that's important to understand.

Because a lot of people, I think,
in the scientific community
that understand
why vaccines are so important,
can really be confused
by someone who would not vaccinate.
Really, we can compare it to someone
not taking their child to the ER.
That's a very dangerous situation to be in
and it shows some lack of empathy
towards your children in some regards.
And really, I can understand that, I can.
But my mom, she was misinformed
and misled by sources that convinced her
that if she was a loving parent,
she wouldn't vaccinate.

Now, when I encountered this
and I talked to my mom,
it didn't obviously go well at first,
because I was wanting to do something
that she thought would either cause autism
or maim me for the rest of my life,
and I said I wanted to do this —
didn't really fly,
didn't really go well.
But the thing that I found interesting
was that when I had started
to get into this circumstance,
do these interviews,
there was one question I proposed.
Wasn't a positive one:
What in the world
have I gotten myself into?
That's what I asked constantly,
because, again, I am not an expert,
I am a normal kid,
and now I'm talking to CNN and Fox News
about a scientific discussion
that really, should I be facilitating,
should I be commenting on?
And a lot of people questioned that,
and for good reason.

But I never claimed things
I didn't understand,
I talked about my personal experiences.
And even at the Senate hearing,
I just talked about
how misinformation is dangerous.
My mom got a lot of her beliefs
from social media, from Facebook
and from organizations that were allowing
their platforms to push lies
that were very dangerous.

Now, I also saw that
as I was doing this —
and I was doing this
as respectfully as I could,
as accurately as I could —
I was getting a lot of criticism,
a lot of very angry people.
When I was in DC
for that testimony I gave,
I was looking around the office building
and three ladies
got in an elevator with me
and said I'm the reason their children
are being maimed and murdered
and I'm basically Hitler.
So that was fun.

(Laughter)

So really, for most circumstances,
for most teenagers and most people,
when they get criticized,
it leads to doubt.
And that doubt leads to questioning,
and that questioning leads to quitting.
Because, when you have a topic
that you're interested in,
or a movement that you want
to be a part of,
and you're taking a stance
and saying what's true,
good ideas don't avoid criticism.
And for especially young people,
they have a hard time dealing with that,
and these important discussions
that need young people to take a part in,
it takes a lot of commitment.

I'm not saying that I'm amazing,
but here's what's important:
through me joining this movement
and this important scientific discussion,
here's what happened.
Facebook changed their platform.
They were going to change
how they approach anti-vax content.
Amazon even removed misinformed
books about autism and vaccines.
And recently, GoFundMe took down
anti-vax campaigns.
We're talking about how movements
like this are causing actual change,
actually impacting the way
this game is played
and the misinformation
that's lying to people
and convincing them
of very dangerous ideas.

Now, before I leave, because I only have
a short amount of time,
I want to give you one
important thing to keep in mind.
One important takeaway from this all.
What you can do and what I did.
I didn't do amazing research and studies
and take information
and present it to people;
I didn't have deep, intellectual,
scientific debates with people.
All I did was share my story.
And that's enough for most people:
to understand the anecdotal experiences,
the real people behind the data.
Because data doesn't resonate with people.
People resonate with people.
And you have to keep that in mind,
because when you are talking
about a topic,
and you're sharing your story,
and sharing what is important,
you stay authentic.
Stay authentic to the data,
to the information,
to the importance of this topic.

If I was talking to an individual
and they said,
"Why are vaccines important?"
I would say nothing alongside
any other answer,
I would not in any way fathomably
give them answer outside of:
people are dying, and that's important.
And that children are dying,
and that's important.
And that we're having disease outbreaks
that should not be here.
And I believe, as John Boyle put it,
these diseases should be in history books
and not in our communities.
So because of that, you need to make
a personal decision to stand up for truth.
You need to make
a personal decision for yourself
to say, "This is accurate,
this is what's real,
and these lies are not OK."
Because it started with me
doing that on a personal level.

I wasn't going from small town
to Senate in a day.
It wasn't like, I go to bed, I wake up
and there's Senator Isakson,
asking me questions about vaccines.
It was a slow progression
and it started with me saying,
"This is true,
my mom doesn't believe it, but that's OK."
Because that doesn't change the truth,
doesn't change what's accurate
and what's important.
And honestly, the biggest thing,
this whole idea of unbreakable:
remain unbroken.
When you stand up for what's true
and you have that criticism,
and you're trying to cause
a movement, don't sway.

Thank you.

(Applause)
