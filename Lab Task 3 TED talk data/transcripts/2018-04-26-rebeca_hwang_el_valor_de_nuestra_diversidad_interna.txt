Holding hands,
we watched the door,
boring holes in it
with our intense stares.
My siblings and I were waiting for our mom
to come back from the hospital,
where my grandmother was having surgery
for advanced cancer.
Finally, the doors opened,
and my mom said,
"She didn't survive the operation."
She burst into tears
and between sobs, said,
"Your grandmother's last wish
was to be buried in her home, in Korea."

I was only 12 when this happened,
and when I recovered
from the initial shock,
my mom's words echoed in my ears:
Grandma wanted to be buried in her "home."
We had emigrated from Korea to Argentina
six years earlier.
We knew no Spanish,
or how we were going to make a living.
We were immigrants in a new land,
where we had lost everything
on account of a scam,
and we had worked very hard
to rebuild our lives.
That's why I couldn't imagine
that after so many years,
our home would still be Korea.
It made me wonder:
Where do I want to be buried someday?
Where is my home?
To be honest, I didn't have
an answer to these questions,
and that really worried me.

This episode triggered
an existential search for my identity.
I was born in Korea, the land of kimchi,
and I grew up in Argentina,
where there was always meat on the table;
truly, it would not be surprising
if today I were 80 percent cow.

(Laughter)

I was educated in the United States,
where I became addicted to peanut butter.
During childhood,
I honestly felt very Argentine,
but my appearance always gave me away.

I remember the first day of high school,
my literature teacher
entered the classroom,
carefully looked at everyone,
stopped in front of me and prophesized:
"You won't pass this class
unless you get a private tutor."
But by then, I was speaking
perfect Spanish —
better than I speak it now, I think,
because it's been years since I left.
And I felt forced to choose
between my Argentine identity
and my Korean one.
Apparently, I couldn't be both,
and I had to abandon my previous identity
in order to adopt the new one.

So when I turned 18, I went to Korea
to see if I could find this home
that I could call my place in the world.
In Korea, people assumed
I was a foreigner, and they'd ask me,
“Why do you speak Korean
with a Spanish accent?”

(Laughter)

Apparently, I was too Korean
to be Argentine,
but too Argentine to be Korean.
Realizing that, honestly,
was very transformative.
I decided not to try and change
what I can't change
and accept it.
In fact, I was inspired
by one of my grandmother's stories.

My grandmother never learned Spanish,
but she was very independent
and managed on her own.
She would walk all around
the streets of Buenos Aires,
even in the most dangerous areas.
One afternoon, she was attacked
and threatened at gunpoint.
They put the gun to her head and said,
"The ring! The ring! Give me your ring!"
They wanted her gold ring,
which was her most prized
possession back then.
Well, my grandmother looked the criminal
in the eyes, sat down on the sidewalk,
and a peaceful smile came onto her face.
My grandmother thought they were saying
"anyó" instead of "ring,"
which in Korean, means "sit down."

(Laughter)

She thought, "Well, it's the last day
of my life, so if I'm leaving,
let's leave with a smile."
She gracefully accepted her fate.
Imagine the face of her attacker —
he must have thought my poor grandmother
was a creature from another planet,
and he took off running, bewildered.

That experience inspired me
to accept my new reality with optimism.
I hadn't managed to find
that place in the world
that I could call home.
But then I wondered:
How many Koreans with Latino mannerisms
that speak Korean with a Spanish accent
are there in the world?
Maybe it could be
an advantage, a useful tool,
a way to stand out in a world
where things are changing very quickly,
where qualities and abilities
can sometimes become obsolete
from one day to the next.

So I decided not to focus on having
100 percent in common
with people I met,
Instead, I realized that I was frequently
the only intersection
between groups of people
that didn't have much in common
and that were even, at times,
in conflict among themselves.
So with this new perspective,
I proudly accepted
the different versions of myself
and even, at times,
allowed me to reinvent myself.

For example, I have to confess
that in high school
I was what we call a bookworm —
I had thick glasses,
had no fashion sense whatsoever.
What's more, I think
the only reason I had friends
was because I let them
copy my homework every morning.
That's true.
Once I went to college,
I was able to find a new identity,
and the "worm" became a popular girl.
OK, granted, it was MIT, so I don't
think the bar was very high —
(Laughter)
but at least I could maintain
that identity.
I changed majors so many times
that my advisor told me
that instead of chemical engineering,
I should get a degree in random studies.

(Laughter)

Over the years, I've had
a lot of identities:
academic, scientist,
social innovator, inventor
entrepreneur, investor;
most recently, networker, teacher
and, most importantly,
a mother, three years ago.
I was so confused that even my accent
couldn't decide who it was.
My friends would joke and say
that it was of such an unknown origin
that I was the only person in the world
who spoke this language, "Rebecanese."

Reinventing oneself can be hard.
For example, when I was
finishing my doctorate,
I was bitten by the entrepreneurship bug.
So suddenly, writing a 400-page thesis
in an office in a basement
seemed less appealing
than starting my own company.
So I had the job of telling
this to my parents,
who are traditional Asian immigrants —
whereas my siblings and I
are the first to attend college —
in other words, that education is the most
important thing in my family.
You can imagine the reaction awaiting me
upon telling my parents
I was abandoning my studies.
So I went to my parents,
but with a secret weapon:
a chart showing the average income
of people who graduated
with doctorates from Stanford
compared to the average incomes
of Stanford students
who abandoned their thesis or doctorate.
Now, I have to confess
that the chart was really skewed
by the founders of Google.

(Laughter)

My mom looked at the chart
and without blinking, said,
"I've always said
you should follow your heart."

(Laughter)

My search for identity these days
isn't about finding my tribe.
Really, it's about finding and accepting
all the different possible
permutations of myself.
It's about cultivating diversity
within myself,
instead of just around me.
Currently, my kids are three years old
and six months old, just turned,
and they were born into
three nationalities and four languages —
and I need to clarify
that I married a Danish guy,
in case I didn't have enough
cultural confusion in my life,
I ended up marrying a Viking.
I think my kids will be the only Vikings
that won't be able to grow a beard
when they grow up.
It'll be hard for them.

(Laughter)

I hope that my kids will have
a multidimensionality
that works for them;
that they see it as a tool
for creating connections
in a world that's every day more global
and also more divided.
I hope that instead of feeling
anxious and worried
that they don't fit into a predefined box,
that they can feel free to experiment
and take control of their life narratives
in their own way.
I hope they can use the unique
combination of values,
cultures, languages
and abilities that they have
to create a world where their identities
are used to unite peoples and people,
and not as an excuse
to generate intolerance —
because identity can be
a double-edged sword:
we can use it to differentiate
ourselves from others,
or to find points of connection.
And when we accept
our multiplicity,
we amplify this power of connection
and forget about the differences a little.

Now, back to my grandmother:
her last wish was also
her final life lesson for me.
It turns out that after many years,
I found out why she wanted
to be buried in Korea.
It wasn't a question
of patriotism or nationality.
She wanted to rest in peace
next to her son,
who had died many years before
she emigrated to Argentina.

My grandmother lived a life
full of deep connections
and indestructible ties,
including those separated by
distances or oceans
or even death.
She had many identities:
matriarch, farmer,
businesswoman, Korean, immigrant,
mother, grandmother.
With her last wish, she taught me
that finding our home isn't about
putting down roots somewhere.
It's about intertwining those roots
with the roots of others
who enrich our lives.

Thank you.

(Applause)
