(Exhales deeply)
Today, right?
Please join me in one big, deep breath
before we dive into talking about sex.
(Laughter)
Just one big, slow, deep breath in.
(Inhales)
And a big, slow, deep breath out.
(Exhales)
OK, now let's talk about sex.
So yes, my name is Emily.
I am a sex educator.
It's the best job in the world.
In the fall of 2010,
I taught a class called
"Women's Sexuality" at Smith College.
It was a 100-level,
introductory-level class,
but I shoehorned in
all the science I could,
all the psychophysiology
and all the neuroscience
and even - God forbid - all the sociology,
and at the end of this really
intense semester,
I asked my students to write down
just one really important thing
that they had learned.
This is what they said:
"I'm normal."
"I am normal."
"Just because my sexuality
is not the same as other women's,
that does not make me abnormal."
"Everything is normal.
Bringing joy and confidence to sex."
"I learned that everything is normal,
making it possible for me to go
through the rest of my life
with confidence and joy."
187 students I had in that class,
and more than half of them
wrote something along the lines of ...
"I'm normal."
So I sat in my office,
and I read those responses
with tears in my eyes.
There was something essential
to my students about feeling normal,
and somehow my class had unlocked
the door to that feeling.
Moments like that are why
I'm a sex educator; it's why I'm here.
I mean, it's why I'm here in Nevada,
but it's why I'm here:
to give everyone on Earth
an experience like the one
my students had,
of unlocking the door
to their own authentic sexual well-being.
So that's what I'm going to do
with you guys today.
(Laughter)
Because it turns out,
we all really are ... normal.
The science says so.
I can prove it!
Are you ready?
Let's do it!
OK!
(Inhales deeply)
The mechanism in your brain
that controls sexual response
is the "dual control model."
The dual control model -
that means there's how many parts?
Two! Thank you!
And if I tell you the first part is
the sexual accelerator or the "gas pedal,"
that means the second part
has to be the ... ?
Brake! They don't let just anybody
into these TED Talks.
(Laughter)
So, the sexual accelerator
notices all the sexually-relevant
information in the environment,
everything you see, hear,
smell, touch, taste or imagine,
that your brain codes
as sexually relevant,
and it sends the signal
that says "Turn on."
And it is functioning at a low level
all the time, including right now,
just the fact that we're talking about sex
is a little bit sexually relevant.
At the same time that
that's happening, in parallel,
your brake is noticing all the very good
reasons not to be turned on right now.
This is everything you see, hear,
smell, touch, taste or imagine
that your brain codes
as a potential threat.
And it sends a signal
that says "Turn off."
So the process of becoming aroused
is the dual process of turning on the ons
and turning off the offs.
Usually when people struggle with
their sexual well-being, it's because -
sometimes there's not enough
stimulation to the gas pedal,
but more often, it's because
there's too much stimulation to the brake,
and all kinds of things can hit the brake.
Like: Are you worried
about unwanted pregnancy?
Are you worried about your kids
walking in, in the middle?
Are you really sure that your partner
loves your sexy body?
Are you really sure
that you love your sexy body?
Did you spend the first
two decades of your life
in a culture that taught you that sex
is dangerous, disgusting and dirty?
That's going to hit the brake, right?
(Laughter)
So the first thing science tells us to do
when we're struggling
with our sexual functioning,
when we want to access
our own authentic sexual well-being,
is to start to think through:
What are things that hit our accelerator?
What are the things that hit our brake?
And especially,
what are some strategies that we can use
in order to minimise the things
that are hitting the brake?
I'm going to talk about two
such evidence-based strategies
at the end of the talk.
But before I do that,
I need to come clean
with you about something,
which is that all that stuff I just said
isn't anywhere near as simple
as I made it sound.
Sorry.
To explain what I mean,
I'll tell you about
the only affective neuroscience
that has ever made me laugh out loud.
OK. So I need you to imagine
that you're a lab rat.
You're a very savvy, experienced lab rat
and the researchers have inserted a probe
into your nucleus accumbens,
a little, sort of jellybean-shaped thing
in the middle of your emotional brain.
It's a painless procedure,
the researchers are clear to say.
Plink!
So you're this sort of
semi-remote-controlled bionic rat,
and you're in a three-chambered box,
here you are in box #1 -
just the ordinary lab environment -
there's a bit of noise, the lights are on,
but it's fine, you're good at this.
So when the researchers
zap the front of your nucleus accumbens,
here's what you do:
Ooh, ooh! What's that? Ooh!
So these are approach, moving toward,
curious behaviors, right?
Ooh! What's that?
And then, in this ordinary
lab environment - the first box -
when they zap the back
of your nucleus accumbens, you do this:
aaah, what the hell is that!?
You're kicking up dust
in the face of the predator.
These are stress, avoidance,
dread responses, right?
Moving away as opposed to moving towards.
Hit the front? Ooh..! What's that?
Hit the back? What the hell is that!?
Got that?
(Laughter)
That's box #1.
So we move into box #2.
Now box #2 is silent, and it's dark,
and it smells like your mother.
(Laughter)
It is ...
I call it the "Rat Spa."
It's the most peaceful, calm state of mind
you can imagine being in,
and when they zap the front
of your nucleus accumbens,
What do you do?
Ooh, ooh! What's that? Ooh!
And then, when they zap the back
of your nucleus accumbens,
What do they do?
Ooh, ooh! What's that?
When you're in a calm, relaxed,
peaceful state of mind,
your brain will interpret
almost any sensation
as something that should be
approached with curiosity.
Even stimulation
that in a different context,
it might interpret as a potential threat
to be moved away from.
But wait ... There's more!
(Laughter)
We move to box #3.
So, here in box #3,
the lights are on really bright,
music's played at different volumes,
you can't even get used to it,
they specify in the research paper -
this made me laugh out loud -
they specify they're playing Iggy Pop.
So ...
(Laughter)
Imagine "Lust for Life" is playing
at lots of different volumes,
you can't get used to it,
you're an introverted bookworm
in the worst nightclub in the world,
and when they zap the front
of your nucleus accumbens,
What do you do?
Aah..! What the hell is that!? Exactly!
They don't let just anybody 
into these talks, that's amazing!
So, when you are in a stressed-out, 
threatened state of mind,
your brain will interpret almost
any sensation as something to be avoided,
as a potential threat -
even stimulation
that in a different context,
it might've interpreted as something
to be approached with curiosity.
All of which is a really nerdy way
of describing a thing all
of us have experienced
in the form of tickling.
(Laughter)
Because, you know,
tickling is not everyone's favorite,
that's fair, I understand,
but at least hypothetically,
you can imagine a world
where you're in a sexy, fun,
flirty state of mind already,
and your certain special someone
starts tickling on you,
and it can feel fun and playful and
potentially lead to further nooky, right?
But if that exact same
certain special someone
tried to tickle when you were
pissed off at them,
(Laughter)
how would that feel?
As one of my students recently put it:
"Violence would shortly ensue."
(Laughter)
But the weird thing is,
it's exactly the same sensation,
but because the context is different,
your brain interprets it
entirely the opposite way.
So when I say, "Turn on the ons,
and turn off the offs,"
it's nowhere near as simple as just
"Touch me here - don't touch me that way."
What it means is, create a context
that allows your brain
to interpret the world
as a pleasurable, safe, sexy place.
For most people - again, people vary - 
but for most people,
that context is low stress,
high affection and high trust.
Those three things are hard enough
to come by in the 21st century,
but they are not actually the keys
that unlock that door
to your authentic sexual well-being.
Sorry!
But this is the big moment, right?
This is when I - here they are.
I've got this satin
shiny pillow with tassels
and two keys lying on it.
Right here: the keys to your 
authentic sexual well-being.
Don't you want to know what they are?
I will explain.
The first key says "confidence,"
and the second key says "joy."
How do they work? What do you mean? 
Where do I get them?
Confidence -
Confidence comes from knowing 
what is true about your body,
your sexuality, your internal experience.
Knowing what's true.
Knowing that you have a brake,
for example, as well as an accelerator.
Knowing that they're sensitive to context,
knowing what's true
even if it's not what you were taught
to expect would be true,
even if it's not what you
were taught "should" be true.
Confidence is knowing what is true.
Joy ...
is loving what's true.
Loving your brake
as much as your accelerator,
loving that they're sensitive to context,
loving what's true
even if it's not what you were taught
to expect would be true,
even - especially - if it's not
what you were taught "should" be true.
And I guarantee you,
you're going to walk out of here
with both keys in your pocket.
I'm going to tell you specifically
how to get your hands on them.
But first, I need to talk to you
about a cartoon panda.
(Laughter)
Have you seen the movie "Kung-fu Panda"?
It's about a cartoon panda named Po;
he becomes a kung-fu master -
"Kung Fu Panda" -
by diligent effort,
the support of his teacher
and the wisdom of the Dragon Scroll.
The Dragon Scroll contains the key
to limitless power!
And when Po first gets his hands 
on the Dragon Scroll he is ...
disappointed
because there's nothing written on it.
It's blank. It just reflects his face.
And then comes his epiphany:
There is no secret ingredient.
It's just ... you.
And that is how
you get your hands on the keys
that unlock the door
to your own authentic sexual well-being,
by turning toward your own 
internal experience with calm curiosity.
Ooh! What's that?
Because it turns out
the key to limitless power
is you.
And now I will tell you
the two concrete, specific,
evidence-based things that you can do
in order to increase your grasp 
on these two keys of confidence and joy.
Ready?
Thing #1: What I want you to do
is stand in front of a mirror
as close to naked as you can tolerate.
(Laughter)
It gets worse!
(Laughter)
So what you're going to do
is look at what you see there,
and you're going to write down
everything that you see that you like.

Of course, first your brain will flood
with culturally-constructed messages
about how your body falls short
of the culturally-constructed ideal -
that's fine,
you have every other minute of the day
to have those self-critical thoughts,
just set them aside, temporarily. 

Right now, you will write down
the things you see that you like.
If it is your eyelashes, write that down.
If it's your toenails, write that down.
And then do it again tomorrow.
And then do it again the next day,
and the next day,
and the more often you do it,
the more obvious it will become to you
what a frickin' frackin'
miracle your body is,
and the more immune you'll become
to all the cultural, noisy crap
that's hitting the brakes.
Option #2: If you genuinely
cannot imagine looking in a mirror
and seeing anything there
that you would like,
here's what I want you to do instead.
I want you to get into a calm,
quiet state of mind,
just for a couple of minutes each day,
and I want you to visualize that door,
that door that stands between you
and your authentic sexual well-being.
And what I want you to do 
when you can see it really clearly,
is that I want you to shine a beacon 
of kindness and compassion on the door.
Because here's the thing about the door:
It's not innate, you weren't born with it.
It was constructed in your brain by
your life experience and by your culture,
and you may hate the culture
that built that door,
you may work to change 
the culture that built that door,
but never turn toward 
the door itself with hate,
because the door is part of you too.
And it is not random, 
it's there to do some work.
If you've been shamed
for what's on the other side of that door,
if you have been shamed
for your sexuality - and who hasn't? -
that door is there trying to protect you 
from social isolation and judgement.
If you have had what's behind that door -
if you had your own sexuality
used against you as a weapon,
if you're a survivor of sexual violence,
your door is there doing
really important work.
I'm talking here about one in four -
you've heard these statistics already -
one in four women in America,
one in six men ...
One in four women in this room,
one in six men.
And two thirds of transgender folks.
If that's you, your door is doing 
the hard work of helping you to survive
in a world where your own sexuality 
can be used against you as a weapon,
and it is working!
You know how I can tell?
Here you are! Surviving.
And I am so grateful to your door 
for doing that really important work,
and I don't know if your door
might be ready to open a little bit
or if your door needs
to stay closed a little while longer,
but I know that the first step is always
to turn toward the door 
with kindness and compassion.
Confidence is knowing what's true
about you, your sexuality,
your internal experience.
Joy is loving what's true
even when it's not what you
were taught "should" be true.
I'm a sex educator.
It's the best job in the world!
(Laughter)
I teach people to live with confidence 
and joy inside their bodies,
but really all that means
is I offer them the science
that helps them find the way
back to themselves.
Because it turns out we all really are ...
Oh, who am I kidding?
We're not just normal!
We, the human species, we're amazing!
We - all of us - are beguiling,
we are courageous,
God knows we are delectable,
we are all the way down the alphabet
to "yopping" and "zesty."
(Laughter)
Your body -
(Cheering) (Applause)
It's you guys! Your body is perfect. 
Exactly the way it is.
The science says so.
And now you can prove it!
Thank you very much.
(Cheering) (Applause)
