Noor Inayat Khan was in the midst of a 
desperate escape.
She had been imprisoned for her activities
as an Allied spy,
but with the help of a screwdriver and 
two other prisoners,
she was back under the Parisian stars.
As she began to run,
her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind 
of events that had brought her here…

Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian 
Muslim father and an American mother,
Noor was raised in a profoundly 
peaceful home.
Her parents were Sufi pacifists,
who put their faith in the power of 
music and compassion.
They moved to Paris,
where Noor studied child psychology 
and published children’s books.
But all this changed with the advent 
of the Second World War.
In May 1940, with the German army 
ready to occupy Paris,
Noor and her brother were faced 
with a difficult choice.
As pacifists, they believed that all 
disputes should be settled non-violently.
But witnessing the devastation 
across Europe,
they decided that standing on the 
sidelines was not an option.

Traveling to England,
Noor volunteered for the Women’s 
Auxiliary Air Force
and trained as a radio operator.
She immersed herself in wireless 
operations and Morse code–
unaware that she was being monitored 
by a secret organization.
The British Special Operations Executive 
was established
to sabotage the Germans 
in Nazi-occupied countries.
As a trained radio operator who knew 
Paris well and spoke fluent French,
Noor was an attractive recruit.
In her interview, she was warned that 
wireless operation
was some of the most dangerous work 
in the intelligence field.
Operators had to lug a conspicuous 
transmitter through enemy territory,
and the clandestine agency couldn’t 
protect her if she was caught.
Noor accepted her assignment immediately.

While she was determined to take her 
pacifist principles as far as possible,
Noor had to learn the art of espionage.
She learned how to contact intelligence 
networks, pick a lock,
resist interrogation and fire a gun.
In June 1943 she landed 
in Angers, south of Paris,
and made her way to the city armed 
with a false passport,
a pistol and a few French francs.
But her network was compromised.
Within a week of her deployment,
all her fellow agents were arrested, 
and Noor was called home.

She convinced her supervisors 
to let her stay–
which meant doing the work of six radio 
operators singlehandedly.
Over the following months,
she tracked and transported supplies 
to the French resistance,
sent reports of Nazi activity back 
to London
and arranged safe passage 
for allied soldiers.
This work was essential to building the 
French resistance
and Allied intelligence networks–
and, ultimately, ending the war.

Protected only by her quick 
thinking and charisma,
she frequently talked her way 
out of questioning.
When the Gestapo searched 
her on the train,
she gave them a casual tour 
of her “film projector.”
When an officer spotted 
her hanging her aerial,
she chatted about her passion for 
listening to music on the radio–
and charmed him into helping 
her set up the cable.
In her entire four month tenure,
her sharp wits and stealth 
never failed her.
But her charm had inspired 
lethal jealousy.
In October 1943, the sister 
of a colleague,
in love with an agent that loved Noor,
sold her address to the Gestapo.

Noor refused to give away any information,
focusing instead on her escape.
Secreting a screwdriver away 
from the guards,
they were able to loosen a skylight 
and slip out into the night.
But just as the prisoners began 
to run for their lives,
an air raid siren alerted her captors.
Noor was caught once again 
and sent to a German prison.
Then, on to Dachau concentration camp.

Despite being tortured, 
deprived and isolated,
Noor gave nothing away.
In the moments before her execution
she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!”
Since her heroic sacrifice,
Noor has been honoured as a hero who 
waged secret battles behind enemy lines–
paving the way for freedom 
without ever taking a life.
