Well, I don't know about you guys,
but for me, the part that I enjoyed
the most about going to school
is when they took us out 
on excursions or we went camping.
I think I liked it a lot because
in that moment you felt free,
you could see your friends
with the light of day,
you could watch the teacher
interact with the real world.
But I think that the most important
was that when we went on excursion
learning and living 
were part of the same thing.
I work as a director and screenwriter
and in 2009 we had a problem.
We had to ideate a TV show for kids
that would tell the children
about the May Revolution
and the problem was
that nothing came to us.
To make things worse, with Sebastian
Mignona and Nicolas Dardano,
we have had the wonderful idea
of offering to the Ministry
of Education's TV channel
to make an animated program;
when none of us had the slightest idea
on how to create a cartoon film.
If you asked me when I was a boy
what I wanted to do 
when I grew older, I would answer:
"I want to work making cartoons."
But it seems that with time 
I began noticing
that animations were done
in the United States.
So if I wanted that work, I would have
to be far from my parents,
and I likely gave up.
But now, I had the chance
to write and direct a cartoon.
So, a bit to reconnect myself with 
what I liked so much from the school,
and also, I think, to see 
if an idea would occur to me,
I went alone on an excursion
to the Buenos Aires' Cabildo.
I arrive at the Cabildo, I go up
to the first floor, turn left,
and I find this image.
The Primera Junta,
and so I get closer, read the names,
Saavedra, Moreno, Castelli, 
Belgrano, Paso,
I look at their expressions, their faces,
and there I had the first revelation.
"This is a pain."
(Laughter)
There's no way —
(Applause)
There's no way you can do
something entertaining with this.
The kids will always prefer to watch
Pokemon, or Dragon Ball Z.
If you think of it, they are able
to store in their brain
five complete seasons
of Pokemon in Japanese,
they watch the movies they like
a million five hundred thousand times
and they know the words by heart.
And what is the difference
between that content and this?
Could we make the May Revolution
as attractive as that?
It seems that in front of content
presented as pedagogical, educational,
you lift a barrier.
Like when they want to sell you
something you do not need.
There, I noticed that I passed through
elementary and middle school
without understanding well 
why San Martin crossed the Andes.
And they must have explained it
to me every August 17th.
But it didn't hit me, I didn't get it,
or it did not stick.
When I returned from the Cabildo,
I started thinking:
"So, what stuck with me from school?"
And then comes the image
of my favorite teacher.
You may as well have a favorite teacher
from elementary or middle school.
Well, Claudio Simari was mine.
He was my teacher from 4th grade.
And I was reminded of him
because he was able to overcome
the barrier that I had placed.
And I remembered two moments
where Claudio did it.
And maybe in that there was
an idea to create this cartoon.
One morning Claudio arrived
and he put on a piece of music.
Claudio chose a song by Terea Parodi
that was called "Hurry up Jose,"
and he wanted to explain to us
the drama of the floods in Formosa.
For those who don't know it,
the song recounts a desperate call
from a woman to her husband
to escape together
before the flood arrives.
That was enough for me to never forget
about the floods of Formosa.
And for each time I listen to
"Hurry up Jose," to be moved again.
The other thing I remember about Claudio
is that one day he decided 
to share with us a personal story.
And he must have done it
in such a sensitive way
that I can even remember where
I was sitting in the classroom.
It turned out that Claudio
was being sent to the war.
Claudio was in the line to enter the plane
that was going to take him
to the Falkland Islands.
He already had his uniform on,
it was dawn, and he suddenly looks
and he notices his parents
had just arrived to say goodbye.
So Claudio went running 
from the line to give a final hug,
and when he returned
they sent him to the back.
And he was one of the few
that failed to enter the plane.
Those were the last flights 
that managed to reach the islands,
and a friend of Claudio died in combat.
With that alone, I would never
forget the Falklands war,
neither that history.
How did Claudio do it?
How did he impart on us
ideas that 30 years later
I still keep remembering?
I realized one thing.
What Claudio did, first of all,
was to tell us stories.
And we lived them 
like we were there with him.
Claudio was a sort of medium,
and we lived that experience
we were in the classroom
but we felt on an adventure.
And the other thing I realized of Claudio
is that he never underestimated us.
We always thanked him for that,
because Claudio
didn't treat us like infants.
We preferred Claudio over those
men and women in television
who would disguise as boys or girls.
At first, they'd come closer
to become your friends,
and then you realize
that they want to teach you
numbers or colors,
or sell you something.
Seems like Claudio knew that 
if you treat a child like a fool,
you ran the risk that, whether the child
thinks that you are the fool,
because you're speaking to them like that,
or that they grow up
thinking they are a fool,
which is much worse.
Children can be lovely, tender, sensitive,
but the truth is they are 
the same who invented bullying.
They can be tyrants, cruel,
fickle beings, just like us.
If they are like us, then why should we
treat them in a different way?
Now, how are we?
That was the question that we asked
ourselves in that moment.
One of my first assignments as
director of "The Dog on the Moon" —
way before creating "Zamba" —
was traveling across the country visiting
public schools and interviewing kids.
I must have interviewed
around 1,500 or 2,000 kids.
They taught me to stop looking
at them from above,
to lower the camera,
to look at them in the eyes,
and to see the world as they see it.
That ended up having a lot
of impact in the project,
because there is something 
from each of those kids in Zamba.
Anyone who had contact with
Argentina's hinterland knows
that the representation
of children we see on TV
is quite different from reality.
Of course, because TV is designed
to treat children as consumers.
Paka-Paka comes to treat
children like children,
and for us as storytellers,
that was an incredible opportunity.
So we started to design the character.
We had to think of an Argentine boy.
If you were to draw an Argentine boy,
what would you do?
What would the hair color be?
His skin color?
What would the width of the nose be?
These are the first sketches of Zamba.
At that time we asked ourselves
if boys and girls would identify
with a boy who did not have super powers,
and that instead of a cape,
he wears a pinafore like them.
Finally, this is the definitive
design of Zamba.
(Applause)
We made him short like Messi for agility
and to facilitate escaping.
He has a backpack so
he's similar to those hectic kids
that are running around
with their backpack on.
We put on his pajamas
under his pinafore.
We made his skin brown.
If you look carefully, he has like
some little horns here,
to make it look a bit more mischievous.
And we gave him a broken tooth,
as a war wound of that battle
we all go through
and is called "infancy."
At this point, you should be asking:
"How is it that a guy who went through
elementary or middle school
without knowing why San Martin
had crossed the Andes,
can write and direct
a program on history?"
Gabriel Di Meglio, who is a historian
and researcher at the CONICET,
was on the team.
Gaby, among other things,
chose to be a historian
because in his childhood he read Asterix.
And I had the chance to sit with him,
face to face, and ask him about history
in the same way Zamba asks San Martin.
Then, what at first seemed a hindrance
ended up being an advantage
because I could write Zamba
from naivety, without solemnity.
We could get our heroes off their horses,
we could brush off the bronze;
we could tell our history through humor.
Today, we live in a time of peace.
But throughout our history
a lot of men and women lost their lives,
the only life they had,
to fight for values like freedom
and independence.
And they could not see
the outcome of that struggle.
It hurt me, for example,
when I came to know
that Belgrano died in a period of anarchy,
with the feeling that all he had done
had rendered useless.
But it was useful.
To all who do Zamba, we like to think
that Belgrano, San Martin,
Sarmiento or Juana Azurduy
would like to know that those values
of freedom and independence
are moving on to the next generation.
Today, kids recognize their struggles
and recognize them as characters
of Zamba on banknotes.
(Applause)
Zamba might be revolutionary?
I have no idea. We can't know this by now.
We may have to wait 20 or 30 years.
And something similar must
happen with teachers, right?
How much time must pass so you can see
the result of their efforts
of their dedication?
And when I was preparing this talk, tin!
My favorite teacher, Claudio,
comes to mind again.
I said, "Well, I have to tell him this,
I have to share this with him."
So I googled him.
Claudio did not have Facebook.
And all I found was a very
improbable e-mail account,
and I wrote an email that said
this I will read to you:
"Hello Claudio.
I was your student 30 years ago,
perhaps you don't remember me.
I write you because I'm one of the makers
of a cartoon called Zamba,
it's shown in Paka-Paka and
I have to give a talk about it.
I needed to tell you that Zamba
is named Jose after "Hurry up, Jose"
the song that one day you showed us
to explain the flooding in Formosa.
And that's also why Zamba
is from Clorinda.
I needed you to know that if you watch
the episode about the Falklands,
you will find a veteran teacher
and it is a tribute to you.
If by chance you see this mail
I hope you are doing well
and that you receive a little
recognition and appreciation
for the work you did with us."
(Applause)
Today, was approaching and
Claudio's reply did not come.
And very recently it arrived.
Claudio is still the guy I remembered.
He went to live in Bariloche,
he was a rural teacher,
he devoted his life to teaching
and he now works there 
at a center of teacher training.
What was I supposed to do?
I went to meet him.
And it turns out that when I arrived,
Claudio had a surprise for me.
I did not remember,
but on the last day of school
Claudio asked us to write
what we liked most of 4th grade.
And these 30 years Claudio had treasured
my answer and my peers'.
(Applause)
"What I liked about the year —
I wrote —
was the camp,
because we played a lot and had fun."
Today, Claudio is here sitting among us.
(Applause)
And I have the possibility
to thank Claudio personally
and in front of you
those gestures, that dedication,
that one day he made us
listen to a song,
that one day he shared with us
such a personal and intimate history
as that of the Falklands war.
Because those little things helped,
they are what ultimately make
that future engineers,
future scientists,
future teachers,
future artists, workers,
and perhaps even future presidents,
today, at school, 
when they go out to recess
they end up shouting:
"Let us be free, nothing else matters."
(Applause)
