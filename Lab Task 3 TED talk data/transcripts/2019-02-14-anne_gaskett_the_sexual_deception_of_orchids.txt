The world’s largest orchid 
grows several meters tall.
The tiniest is practically invisible.
Some bloom high up in trees,
while others live underground.
All in, there are around 28,000 species 
of orchid on earth –
about as many as all the bird, 
mammal and reptile species combined.
They grow all over the world,
bearing every imaginable colour, shape, 
and pattern.
And there’s a cunning purpose 
behind these elaborate displays:
many orchids trick insects,
sometimes even into having sex with them.

Like other flowers,
most orchids need to attract insects
to gather their pollen and 
carry it between plants.
But unlike most flowers,
which attract a range of pollinators 
with sweet nectar,
these masters of deception 
deploy other tactics–
like pretending to be an insect’s mate,
letting off alluring scents,
and mimicking the appearance 
of other species.

One of their most intriguing methods 
is sexual deception.
Through a combination of sexy shapes 
and pheromones,
orchids convince insects 
to mate with them.
Take the bee orchid,
whose petals look almost exactly like 
the velvety body of a bee.
This disguise is so convincing 
that male bees land on the orchid
and try to have sex with it,
picking up pollen as they go.
Other orchids have evolved contrasting 
colours and ultraviolet spots–
invisible to humans but 
irresistible to insects.
Still others have tactile ‘love-handles’
that ensure insects are positioned 
precisely for pollination.
When a male wasp lands on the
hammer orchid, for example,
his enthusiastic mating motion 
flips a hinge in the flower,
forcing his body into the pollen.
At the next flower he visits,
that same hinge pushes his pollen-covered 
body onto the stigma,
fertilizing it.
Some orchids make such convincing mates
that insects even ejaculate on them,
wasting valuable sperm.

But the most vital component of 
sexual deception is scent:
orchids mimic the precise scent 
of a single insect species.
This is possible because many insects 
and flowers
produce simple organic compounds 
called hydrocarbons,
which form a layer that protects 
their bodies from drying out.
The precise blend of compounds 
in this layer is species-specific.
Its scent can double as a way for insects 
to attract potential mates,
known as a sex pheromone.
Over the course of many 
thousands of years,
random compound combinations 
have given some orchid species
precisely the same signature scent 
as particular insect species.
This matching scent allows them to 
attract male pollinators
who fall over and over again
for the flowers masquerading as females
of their own species.

Sexual deception isn’t the only trick 
orchids have up their sleeves.
Their oldest scam is mimicking the shapes 
and colours
of other nectar-producing flowers—
but without the sweet nectar.
Some orchids also masquerade as places 
where insects lay their eggs.
One species not only has the colour and 
appearance of rotting meat;
it emits a scent of decay as well–
drawing in flies who deposit 
their eggs on the flower
and unwittingly pollinate the plant.
Other orchids look and smell just like
the fungi on which certain insects
lay their eggs.

Where do all these bizarre adaptations 
come from?
Random genetic mutations in orchids 
may result in a trait–
like a scent or a shape–
that, by chance, matches the needs 
of a single insect species.
The huge diversity within the insect 
world also increases the likelihood
that an orchid will find 
a unique audience.
Able to make more seeds and offspring with
the help of its dedicated pollinators,
the orchid successfully reproduces 
in isolation,
and becomes a new species.
But because of their dependence on 
sometimes just one pollinator species,
orchids are also vulnerable,
and many quickly go extinct.

Over time, though,
more orchid species have formed 
than died out,
and orchids are some of the most diverse 
flowering plants.
They have such exuberant and otherworldly 
shapes
that they occasionally deceive 
human senses, too:
In their petals we see what appear 
to be tiny, dancing people,
monkey’s faces, spiders,
and even birds in flight.
