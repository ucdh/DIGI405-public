The talented young herbalist named Xu Xian
was in trouble.
It should have been a victorious moment–
he had just opened his very 
own medicine shop.
But he bought his supplies from 
his former employer,
and the resentful man 
sold him rotten herbs.

As Xu Xian wondered what to do with this 
useless inventory,
patients flooded into his shop.
A plague had stricken the city,
and he had nothing to treat them.
Just as he was starting to panic,
his wife, Bai Su Zhen, produced a recipe
to use the rotten herbs as medicine.
Her remedy cured all the plague-afflicted
citizens immediately.
Xu Xian’s former boss even had to buy back
some of the rotten herbs
to treat his own family.

Shortly after, a monk named Fa Hai 
approached Xu Xian,
warning him that there was 
a demon in his house.
The demon, he said, was Bai Su Zhen.
Xu Xian laughed.
His kindhearted, resourceful wife 
was not a demon.

Fa Hai insisted.
He told Xu Xian to serve his wife realgar
wine on the 5th day of the 5th month,
when demons’ powers are weakest.
If she wasn’t a demon, he explained, 
it wouldn’t hurt her.

Xu Xian dismissed the monk politely,
with no intention of serving 
Bai Su Zhen the wine.
But as the day approached, 
he decided to try it.

As soon as the wine touched 
Bai Su Zhen’s lips,
she ran to the bedroom, 
claiming she wasn’t feeling well.
Xu Xian prepared some medicine 
and went to check on her.
But instead of his wife,
he found a giant white serpent with a
bloody forked tongue in the bed.
He collapsed, killed by the shock.

When Bai Su Zhen opened her eyes,
she realized immediately what 
must have happened.
The truth was that Bai Su Zhen was 
an immortal snake
with formidable magical powers.
She had used her powers to take a 
human form
and improve her and 
her husband’s fortunes.

Her magic couldn’t revive Xu Xian,
but she had one more idea to save him:
an herb that could grant longevity 
and even bring the dead back to life,
guarded by the Old Man of the South Pole
in the forbidden peaks of the 
Kun Lun Mountains.
She rode to the mountains on a cloud,
then continued on foot passed gateways 
and arches
until she reached one 
marked “beyond mortals”
hanging over a silver bridge.

On the other side,
two of the Old Man’s disciples 
guarded the herb.
Bai Su Zhen disguised herself as a monk
and told them she’d come to invite 
the Old Man to a gathering of the gods.
While they relayed her message,
she plucked some leaves 
from the herb and ran.

The servants realized they had been 
tricked and chased her.
Bai Su Zhen coughed up a magic ball 
and threw it at one.
As the other closed in on her,
she put the herb under her tongue 
for safekeeping,
but its magic forced both of them 
into their true forms.
As the crane’s long beak 
clamped around her,
the Old Man appeared.
Why, he asked, would she risk her life 
to steal his herb
when she was already immortal?

Bai Su Zhen explained 
her love for Xu Xian.
Even if he didn’t want to be with her 
now that he knew she was a demon,
she was determined to 
bring him back to life.
The two had a karmic connection dating 
back more than a thousand years.
When Bai Su Zhen was a small snake,
a beggar was about to kill her,
but a kind passerby rescued her.
Her rescuer was Xu Xian in a past life.
Touched by her willingness 
to risk her life for him,
the Old Man permitted her to leave the 
mountain with the immortal herb.

Bai Su Zhen returned home 
to revive Xu Xian.
When he opened his eyes,
the terrified look frozen on his face 
became a smile.
Demon or not,
he was still happy to see his wife.
