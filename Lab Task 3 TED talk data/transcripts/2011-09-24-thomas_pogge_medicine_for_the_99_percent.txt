I hope you're all healthy,
and I hope we will all remain healthy
for the indefinite future.
But that hope is a little bit unrealistic,
and so I've got a second back-up hope.
The second back-up hope is that,
insofar as we have health problems,
we will have good medicines
to take care of them.
Medicines are very cheap to produce
and they're very effective —
much more pleasant, actually,
than the alternatives:
hospitalization, operations,
emergency rooms, the morgue ...
None of these are good things.
So we should be very grateful
that we have pharmacologists around,
people who research these things
and develop new medicines.
And we should be grateful
that we have a pharmaceutical industry
that supports their activities.
But there is a problem,
and you can tell from the fact
that the pharmaceutical
industry isn't well-loved.
In fact, in terms of popularity, they rank
just about with the tobacco companies
and the arms manufacturers.

So that's the problem
I want to talk with you about today.
How would you organize
the pharmaceutical industry?
If we did it all over again,
how would you do it?
I think we would think
of three main principles.
The first one is:
we want patients to have access
to all the important medicines.
Remember, these things
are very cheap to produce.
So everybody in the world
should have access
to all the important medicines.
Secondly, we want innovative activities,
the research and development
that pharmaceutical companies do,
to track the diseases that are
the most important, the most damaging.
We want them to aim
for the greatest health impact.
And thirdly, we want
the whole system to be efficient.
We want as little of the money
that goes into the system to go to waste,
to go for overhead,
for red tape, and so on and so forth.
Very simple three points.

Now what about the existing system?
I think it does poorly
on all these three counts.
First, universal access: forget about it.
The vast majority of human beings
do not have access to medicines,
at least while they're still under patent.
There are extremely high markups,
and that's the problem.
The problem is that even though
these medicines are very cheap to produce,
they cost a great amount of money
during the time that they're under patent,
and the reason for that is
that rich people can pay a lot of money.
Pharmaceutical companies
have a temporary monopoly;
they price for the rich,
they forget about the poor.

The second problem is innovation.
Again, we don't focus on the diseases
that do the most damage,
and that's often put
into the phrase "the 10/90 gap."
Ten percent of all the money spent
on pharmaceutical research
is focusing on diseases
that account for ninety percent
of the global burden of disease.
And vice versa — ninety percent
of the money is spent on diseases
that account for only ten percent
of the global burden of disease.
So there's a huge mismatch between
where we spend the research money
and where the greatest problems are.

Now, both these problems —
the problem with innovation
and the problem with access —
have to do with this:
the distribution of money in the world.
It's extremely unequal.
The blue area here is the top quarter
of the human population.
They have more than ninety percent
of the global household income.
The bottom half of humanity,
on the other hand,
has not even three percent
of global household income.
So if you're a pharmaceutical company
and you look for profit opportunities,
you look at this sort of chart and say,
"Where's the money?
What am I going to research?
Who am I going to provide with medicines?"
And again, that is in the context
of there being only one way
in which pharmaceutical companies
make money under the present system,
that is, through patent-protected markups.
That's how they make their money,
through markups.
And if you make money through markups,
then obviously, you will go to where
the people have the most income.

Now in terms of overall efficiency,
the system also does very, very poorly.
A lot of money goes
for lobbying politicians
in order to extend patent periods —
to "evergreen," as it's called.
Data exclusivity and so on.
A lot of money goes for gaming,
where brand-name companies pay generic
companies to delay entry, for example.
A lot of money goes to take our patents
in all the different jurisdictions.
Money goes – even larger
amounts – for litigation.
They're litigating endlessly —
brand-name company
against brand-name company,
brand-name company
against generic company ...
Enormous amounts go there.
People say pharmaceutical companies
make a lot of profit.
Well, yes and no; they do, but a lot of it
goes to these wasteful activities.
Deadweight losses — I won't
even tell you what they are,
because it's too complicated.
But there's also wasteful marketing.
A lot of the money
that pharmaceutical companies make
goes into advertising campaigns,
trying to win favor with doctors,
trying to persuade patients
to try this medicine.
And these marketing battles,
of course, are a pure waste,
because what one company spends
to get patients over to their drug,
another company spends to win them back.

And then there is counterfeiting
in the developing countries.
A lot of the drugs there, often more than
fifty percent of what's sold,
are counterfeit drugs, where people say,
"Because the drug is so expensive,
I can offer you a cheaper version."
But of course it's not the real thing,
it's either diluted
or it's completely inert.
So on the whole, all the money
that is spent on pharmaceuticals —
and it's roughly a trillion dollars
now, per annum —
much of that money
is absolutely going to waste,
it's not going to where
it should be going,
namely, to the development
of new medicines
and to the manufacturing
of ones that we already have.

Now, many people think
that the solution to the problem
is moral pressure
on pharmaceutical companies.
And, sure — pharmaceutical companies
have moral obligations,
just like we do.
When we have to make a choice,
often between having a little extra money
and saving a human life,
we often feel that we have a duty
to spend the money
and save the life.
And why should pharmaceutical
companies be any different?
But really, it isn't realistic
to expect pharmaceutical companies
to act as well as you
or maybe I might act.
And the reason is threefold.
One is that pharmaceutical companies
are bound to their shareholders.
The executive of such a company
wouldn't last very long
if he gave a lot of money away,
or she, for good purposes,
and thereby lost money
for the shareholders.
They would be replaced.
Also, pharmaceutical companies stand
in fierce competition with one another,
and if you do more, if you are nicer
than the other company,
sooner or later, you'll be
driven out of the market.
You will not survive.
The other company will gain market share.
And finally, remember —
the entire industry
is dependent for its income
on one thing and one thing only: markups.
And ultimately, you have
to be sustainable.
If you spend a lot of money
on helping poor people
and you don't get paid for it,
and you lose this money;
you cannot continue
with your innovative activities.
So for these reasons,
it's just unrealistic
to expect that pharmaceutical companies
will solve the problem
on moral grounds.

Who, then, should solve the problem?
I suggest it has to be us.
We, citizens and politicians,
have to do better
in terms of regulating
the pharmaceutical industry,
focusing them,
giving them the right incentives,
focusing them on the problems
that really matter.
The potential gains here are enormous.
About one third of all deaths
each day, each year,
are due to the diseases of poverty
in the developing world.
Fifty thousand people every day
die prematurely from these diseases.
And that's not even counting
all the diseases
that we know only too well
in the rich countries:
cancer, heart disease and so on.
Again, poor people die often much earlier,
because they don't have good medical care,
including good medicines.
And even in rich countries, many patients
are not getting the best medicine.
That's sometimes due to the fact
that insurance companies won't cover it,
because the price
is so absolutely ridiculous.
And it's also due, sometimes,
to the fact that doctors
and patients are falsely influenced
by advertising campaigns
of pharmaceutical companies.

So what can we do?
How can we change the system?
I want to show you a way
in which we can better incentivize
pharmaceutical innovation and
the provision [of] medicines
to poor people and rich alike.
And that is the Health Impact Fund.
The Health Impact Fund is basically
opening up the second track
with which pharmaceutical innovators
can be rewarded for their activities.
They have a choice.
They can either go with the old system,
with patent-protected markups,
or they can go with the new system,
being rewarded on the basis
of the health impact
of the medicines that they develop.
And with each particular medicine,
they have their choice.
So they can be partly on one track,
partly on the other,
with different products.

Now, how would
the Health Impact Fund work?
There would be a fixed
reward pool every year.
We start with maybe six billion dollars,
but that can eventually be revved up.
Remember that the total money
that the world spends on pharmaceuticals
is a trillion.
So it's a thousand billion;
six billion is a drop in the bucket.
It's relatively small,
but it would work with six billion,
and we'd get a lot of bang for the buck
if we introduced the Health Impact Fund
with just six billion dollars.
If you have a product
and you want to register it
with the Health Impact Fund,
you will be rewarded
for a period of 10 years.
During these 10 years, you get a share
of these annual reward pools.
That share would be proportional to
your share of the health impact achieved
by all these registered products.
So if your product accounts
for eight percent of the health impact
of all the registered products,
you get eight percent
of the reward money that year.
That repeats for 10 years,
and at the end of the 10 years,
your product goes generic,
so you basically lose
any further income from it.
Each year, the health impact
from your product would be evaluated,
and you would be paid on that basis.

Now, if you take that reward
from the Health Impact Fund,
you can't claim the other reward,
you can't mark up the price.
You have to sell at cost.
What does that mean?
Well, it doesn't mean
that the pharmaceutical company tells us
what their cost is;
but rather, our preferred way
of determining what the real cost is
of making a medicine, of manufacturing it,
is to ask the registrant to put
the production of the medicine
out for tender, let generic companies
compete for the production,
and then the innovator would buy
the product from the cheapest supplier
and would sell it at that same
lowest possible price to patients.
So the innovator would make no money
at all on selling the product,
but would make all its money
from the health impact rewards.

Now, how do we assess the impact
of the introduction of a medicine?
Well, we assess it relative
to the preceding state of the art.
So some people,
before the medicine came along,
had no treatment at all.
Now for the first time, they have
treatment, because it's cheap;
people can afford it.
So here, the impact is the difference
between being treated
and not being treated.
In other cases, the new product
is better than the old products,
and so a person gets switched over
to a better product,
and we pay for the impact,
for the difference the new product makes.
If you have a product
on the Health Impact Fund
and you simply switch somebody
from an existing product
to another product, to your product,
and it's no better,
you get no money.

That's in stark contrast
to the existing system,
where you get a lot of money
for switching somebody from one product
to an equal product that is your product.
The Health Impact Fund
does not pay for that.
We quantify health impact in terms
of quality-adjusted life years.
That method has been around
for about 20 years,
and it's very easy to explain.
Just think of a human life
as a kind of plank.
It's eighty inches long, one inch high.
And when you die prematurely
before you reach 80,
well, the plank is a little shorter.
And if you're sick during
the time that you live,
the plank is a little bit thinner.
And what diseases can nibble away,
medicines can restore,
or medicines can avert
the taking away of these parts.
And they get paid for that.
That's the method, basically.

Now, we look – of course,
each year, we have to assess.
We have to spend
a considerable amount of money
looking at how these various medicines
that are registered
with the Health Impact Fund
are doing in various countries.
And here, statistics is extremely helpful.
You all know how exit polling works.
This is a similar method.
You look for a statistically
significant sample,
and then try to figure out
what the health impact of the medicine is
in different locations,
in different demographic groups ...
And, of course, you look very carefully
at the actual world —
this is in contrast to how medicines
are today rewarded.
Sometimes, there is a reward
based on performance,
but it's the performance in clinical
trials, in the laboratory, if you like,
and not the performance in the real world.
The Health Impact Fund
would look at real-world impact.
It would look not just
at the quality of a drug,
but also at how widely it is distributed,
whether the innovator manages
to target those patients
who can benefit the most,
and also, how well the drug
is used in the field.
So innovators would have much
stronger incentives than they do now
to make sure that every patient
who takes the drug
knows exactly how to take it
to optimal effect.
Today, most packaged inserts are not even
translated into local languages,
and so it's not surprising that patients
don't make the best use of the product.

Now, how would the financing work?
Basically, the Health Impact Fund,
as I said, could start
with something like six billion dollars.
It's not nothing, but it's also
not a lot of money,
compared to what the world is already
spending on pharmaceuticals.
So the best way to think of it
is as a new way of paying
for what we are already paying for,
namely, new medicines.
You pay with one hand
through the tax system,
but you get something back
with the other hand,
because you also get
these medicines for cheap.
This is not just for poor people —
everybody will have these Health Impact
Fund registered medicines at cost,
at a very low price.

One very important hurdle here,
politically, is that we have to make sure
that we have long-term
visibility for innovators,
that innovators know
that the money is actually there,
and so we need governments
to fund the Health Impact Fund,
because only governments can make
predictable commitments
for a long period of time.
Because the Health Impact Fund
registration is voluntary,
you basically have
a self-adjusting reward rate.
As the rate rises too high,
innovators will come in
and drive the rate down.
Conversely, if the rate falls too low,
innovators would be reluctant
to register, and the rate will recover.
So the rate will always be
at a reasonable level.

The Health Impact Fund
is beneficial for all parties.
It benefits innovators
by giving them a new market,
and most importantly, by overcoming
their public relations problems
that we started with.
It benefits patients,
because patients are much more likely
to get the right medicine,
and also for these
medicines to be developed,
the medicines that we most need.
And it also benefits governments
or taxpayers, if you like,
because it creates a permanent source
of pharmaceutical innovation
that will be here for all future times.
It's a kind of machine that always
directs pharmaceutical innovation
to where we have the greatest problems,
maybe for diseases
that don't even exist yet.
The Health Impact Fund
will always channel innovation
in the direction where it's most needed.

Now, we have a little bit of help already.
You can see here the number of people
who have agreed to help us,
but we want your help as well.
We want you to join us,
maybe to talk with your government
to help us with publicity,
to help us with your ideas in perfecting
the Health Impact Fund scheme.
And what we most urgently need
for the moment
is to start a pilot.
The pilot would introduce one medicine
into one jurisdiction
on the Health Impact Fund model.
The innovator would get paid according
to the cost of the medicine for the sales,
and would then get additional money
on the basis of the health impact.
Here, we need funding for the rewards,
funding for the assessment,
and in particular, we need
political support
to get politicians to support
a pilot of that sort.

If you have any further questions,
don't hesitate to write us
and contact us at this address.

Thank you very much.
