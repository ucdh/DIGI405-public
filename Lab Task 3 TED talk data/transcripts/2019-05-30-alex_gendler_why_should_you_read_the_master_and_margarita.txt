The Devil has come to town.
But don’t worry – all he wants to do 
is stage a magic show.

This absurd premise forms the central plot
of Mikhail Bulgakov’s masterpiece,
"The Master and Margarita."
Written in Moscow during the 1930s,
this surreal blend of political satire, 
historical fiction, and occult mysticism
has earned a legacy as one of the 20th 
century’s greatest novels–
and one of its strangest.

The story begins when a meeting between
two members of Moscow’s literary elite
is interrupted by a strange gentleman 
named Woland,
who presents himself as a foreign scholar
invited to give a presentation 
on black magic.
As the stranger engages the two companions
in a philosophical debate
and makes ominous predictions 
about their fates,
the reader is suddenly transported 
to first-century Jerusalem.
There a tormented Pontius Pilate
reluctantly sentences Jesus of 
Nazareth to death.
With the narrative shifting between 
the two settings,
Woland and his entourage– Azazello, 
Koroviev, Hella,
and a giant cat named Behemoth–
are seen to have uncanny magical powers,
which they use to stage their performance
while leaving a trail of havoc 
and confusion in their wake.

Much of the novel’s dark humor comes 
not only from this demonic mischief,
but also the backdrop 
against which it occurs.
Bulgakov’s story takes place in the same 
setting where it was written–
the USSR at the height of the 
Stalinist period.
There, artists and authors worked 
under strict censorship,
subject to imprisonment, exile, 
or execution
if they were seen as undermining 
state ideology.
Even when approved, their work–
along with housing, travel, 
and everything else–
was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy.
In the novel, Woland manipulates this 
system along with the fabric of reality,
to hilarious results.
As heads are separated from bodies 
and money rains from the sky,
the citizens of Moscow react with 
petty-self interest,
illustrating how Soviet society bred greed
and cynicism despite its ideals.
And the matter-of-fact narration 
deliberately blends
the strangeness of the supernatural 
events
with the everyday absurdity 
of Soviet life.

So how did Bulgakov manage to publish 
such a subversive novel
under an oppressive regime?
Well… he didn’t.
He worked on "The Master and Margarita"
for over ten years.
But while Stalin’s personal favor
may have kept Bulgakov safe 
from severe persecution,
many of his plays and writings 
were kept from production,
leaving him safe but effectively silenced.
Upon the author’s death in 1940,
the manuscript remained unpublished.
A censored version was eventually 
printed in the 1960s,
while copies of the unabridged manuscript 
continued to circulate
among underground literary circles.
The full text was only published in 1973,
over 30 years after its completion.

Bulgakov’s experiences with censorship 
and artistic frustration
lend an autobiographical air to the 
second part of the novel,
when we are finally introduced 
to its namesake.
‘The Master’ is a nameless author who’s 
worked for years on a novel
but burned the manuscript 
after it was rejected by publishers–
just as Bulgakov had done 
with his own work.
Yet the true protagonist is the Master’s 
mistress Margarita.

Her devotion to her lover’s abandoned 
dream bears a strange connection
to the diabolical company’s escapades–
and carries the story to 
its surreal climax.

Despite its dark humor and 
complex structure,
"The Master and Margarita" is, at its heart,
a meditation on art, love, and redemption
that never loses itself in cynicism.
And the book’s long overdue publication 
and survival against the odds
is a testament to what Woland tells the 
Master:
“Manuscripts don’t burn.”
