I'm an energy journalist
and a self-proclaimed energy nerd,
but today, if you're cool with it,
I'd like to try out a new career,
and you guys are going to be
my guinea pigs.
I'll be taking on the role
of relationship counselor.
Okay, okay.
I'm talking about
our relationship with energy,
with electricity, gasoline,
wind turbines, all of it.
Or rather, for most of us,
it's a lack of a relationship.
See, us and energy, we don't talk.
We're disconnected, estranged.
Here's an example:
When I first started covering energy,
I asked a bunch of friends
what questions they had.
And one of my best friends,
a physics professor, super smart, asked:
"Are we still burning coal?"
And I was like, huh.
Are we still burning coal?
Here we were, a physics PhD
and an energy journalist
with an engineering degree, stumped.
Because here's the thing,
"Are we still burning coal?"
is a totally reasonable question.
It's so easy to go through life
using energy every day, every moment,
while knowing next to nothing about it.
Energy makes everything we do possible,
and yet we treat it
as an insignificant other.
And because us and energy,
we don't really talk,
we're embarrassed
to even ask questions like,
"Are we still burning coal?"
And in case you're curious,
yes, we are; a lot of it.
As a journalist, though,
I get this amazing license
to ask questions, however basic.
And I've spent nearly three years
asking questions
to everyone from power grid engineers
to energy economists.
What have I learned?
It's a problem that most of us
are on the outs with energy.
I don't have to remind you
that we're facing
some major energy challenges,
and we can't solve them if we treat energy
as an insignificant other.
But there's good news.
The tools we need to rekindle
the relationship are already here.
So, to kick off our counseling session,
let's take a step back
and figure out how we ended up
with this energy estrangement,
this communication breakdown.
What is energy, anyway?
That's a good place to start.
The physics definition in five words:
energy is the capacity to do work.
All that means is anything
that has to move or change,
energy is the stuff
that makes it possible.
It comes in many forms.
Chilling a beer in your fridge,
that takes energy.
The beer itself:
energy too, calories.
While drinking said beer, brainstorming
what you're going to be for Halloween,
neurons are moving around
in your brain using energy.
And making that sweet
Oompa Loompa costume -
(Laughter)
more energy.
Yeah, that's me.
(Laughter)
No, this is important:
We can move energy around,
change it from one form to another,
like when we burn coal
to make electricity,
but we can never create
or destroy it.
Pending advancements in space travel,
what's here on earth
and what's coming from the sun,
that's all we got.
Okay, on to our relationship history,
the movie montage version.
Jumping to pre-agricultural humans,
50,000 years ago or so,
we took in energy as food,
plants and animals,
and we used it by doing stuff:
chopping wood, going for a walk.
We straight-up humans
were our own industrial complex.
A power plant, factory, supercomputer
all rolled into one kick-ass body.
And our energy use was limited
by how much we could eat
and how much we could move:
a few thousand calories a day.
Then, big breakthrough:
we domesticated animals,
using them as batteries,
essentially storing energy for us.
Now, we're commanding energy
outside our bodies.
Then comes the water wheel,
the windmill, we invent the steam engine,
we're burning coal,
and by 1900, not that long ago,
we're here, using about
12,000 calories a day per person.
Then we built the modern electric grid,
the world's largest machine,
we figure out nuclear power,
we've got the ability to send humans
to the freaking moon,
finally the digital revolution,
those giant data servers
off in the desert, and boom:
here we are in 2016,
where each American uses
the equivalent of 208,000 calories a day.
Seriously.
It's like we've each got
a 100-person battalion at our disposal.
It's on the order of the energy
in a lightning bolt.
We're all Zeuses!
And most of this change happened
in barely more than a century.
So, as we turned into Zeuses,
how did our relationship change?
Well, I can tell you exactly
what it felt like in the pre-Zeus era.
No, I'm not a time traveler,
but I do run ultramarathons.
Last month, I- woo, yeah!
I ran a hundred mile race
in the mountains of Idaho,
up and down mountains,
over scree, through mud.
(Applause)
Thank you!
(Applause)
(Cheers)
For almost 29 hours,
burning 15,000 calories, give or take.
And during that ordeal,
energy and me, we were super tight.
I had my caloric intake
planned out to the minute,
and I was constantly checking in.
Eat this gel now, back off the pace,
drink more water, go hard down that hill,
no, not that hard,
now you're getting bloated, and oh!
There comes the vomit!

(Laughter)
You can only ramp up a human power plant
so much before it breaks down.
And to avoid that, I had to be
intimately connected with my energy.
I imagine maybe that's what it was like
to be a human, hundreds of years ago.
But now, as our energy use skyrocketed,
we grew less aware of it.
We stopped constantly checking in,
and we began to blindly trust our energy.
We went from using things
we could see and touch,
to using machines operating
hundreds of miles away.
Say you want to make a peanut butter
banana smoothie and you turn on a blender.
That blender is connected to the outlet,
the substation down the street,
the transmission lines;
it's an uninterrupted chain
all the way back to a power plant.
And when you hit blend,
a generator in that power plant
spins slightly faster or slower
to accommodate you.
For real!
But you don't see that, right?
You just see the smoothie.
That invisible system, it's like magic.
You trust that it'll work.
Over the past century, we left that close,
instinctual energy awareness behind,
and we began to blindly trust our energy.
And as we did, we took
that relationship for granted.
And that's how energy
became our insignificant other.
So, implications...
Well, as we grew to think
about our energy systems less,
we also grew to depend on them more.
And that dependency only shows itself
when energy's gone,
when the power goes out
and you find yourself eating
a cold can of beans for dinner.
Now here's what's dangerous:
not just that our energy
appetites have grown,
but that most of us don't realize
how much they've grown,
or what our energy appetites even are,
so that when we need to tackle challenges
involving our energy,
we're so disengaged,
we've got no idea where to start.
When I was running that hundred mile race,
I hit some energy complications.
Remember the vomit?
But, I was able to handle them
because I was dialed in to my energy.
In any relationship, problems will pop up.
With energy, these involve climate change,

the economy,
geopolitics,
energy poverty.
The crux of a good relationship
is being able to face problems, together.
But when it comes to our energy,
how can we face problems
if we're not even on speaking terms?
There are all kinds
of technological fixes out there,
but they'll be rendered useless
if we can't change the relationship.
Relax, take a breath.
I'm not going to leave you
with bleakness.
As your energy relationship counselor,
I've got some practical advice,
but as I said,
this is a new role for me,
so I consulted
the WikiHow illustrated guide
on how to fix a relationship
in four easy steps.
Because of course that exists, right?
Okay.
Step one: understand the problem.
Well, just by being here,
you've got a great start.
With energy, a key problem
is that we've grown habituated
to having such a fabulous,
reliable partner,
a partner we took for granted,
so we stopped checking in.
Which brings us to step two:
learn to discuss better.
(Laughter)
There's no need to bottle up
those energy questions.
It's okay to ask,
"Are we still burning coal?"
or "Can I put a wind turbine on my house?"
And you can practice
some listening skills too.
Maybe next month
actually read your utility bill,
the one you've got setup on auto-pay.
(Laughter)
It's okay, I do too.
So, communication, it takes two sides,
and that poor communication
we're accustomed to,
it's not actually your fault.
Until recently, it was nearly impossible
to have a real discussion with your energy
even in your own home.
Utilities track every bit of electricity
from a power plant to your house,
but your house itself is a black box.
There's no itemized list
on that bill you get,
so how much goes
to your computer, your lights,
or poof! just dissipated as lost heat,
who knows?
That's changing.
Advancements like smart meters
and smart appliances,
these let us peek inside the black box.
But, information alone
will not repair our broken relationship,
so step three: you've got to reconnect.
Things like holding hands
and gazing into each others' eyes,
these can go a long way
toward rekindling the flame.
Let's be real, energy is not
the only relationship in our lives
so those ways to reconnect
need to be simple,
and they can't add
to our information overload.
Here's a fun one I've been trying:
going back to those 208,000 calories a day
we each consume, pick an activity,
say, binge-watching the latest season
of Orange is the New Black.
And now think, if I had to eat
the amount of calories
that matched the energy my TV uses,
it would be a nice big slice
of chocolate cake,
and that's not even counting
those data servers off in the desert.
So, you don't need cutting edge
technology to reconnect,
you just need a creative, open mind.
Slipping on your energy goggles
and starting to see those connections
out in the world,
it will change your relationship.
So, we've understood the problem,
we're discussing better,
we're practicing that connection.
Now we're ready for step four:
figuring out how to move forward.
I'm really excited for the future.
Our relationship with energy
is changing on a personal level
and a societal one too.
The 20th century grid was designed
to be magic and invisible,
to keep energy at a distance.
But innovations happening now
can bring you back into the relationship.
Things like electricity prices
that change dynamically,
the ability to generate and store power
in your own home,
detailed data on our energy behavior,
these things can drastically
reduce our energy use and costs,
but getting them right requires us all
taking a more active role
in our relationship.
You don't have to be like me
running a hundred mile race
and constantly obsessing
over your energy.
But you can check in
every once and a while.
Because when we treat energy
as a significant other, a true partner,
instead of just seeing energy problems,
we're able to see energy solutions.
Thank you!
(Applause)
