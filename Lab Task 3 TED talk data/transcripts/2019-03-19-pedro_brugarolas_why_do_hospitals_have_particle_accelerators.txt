This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG.
The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm,
whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner.
The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body.
If he has a tumor,
cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG,
which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner.
PET tracers such as FDG
are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics,
and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator,
just hours earlier.

The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron,
and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals.
It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles
like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path.
When the protons reach 
their maximum speed,
they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water
with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18.
When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms,
it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron.
This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18,
a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan.
In a little under two hours,
about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay,
so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done.

So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases?
Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions
to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules,
creating radiotracers.
The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe.
FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose
can signal the presence of cancer;
the location of an infection;
or the slowing brain function of dementia.

The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan.
When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body,
it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target—
whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise.
Within a few minutes,
a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area
and the rest has cleared from circulation.
Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET,
or positron emission tomography, scanner.

The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible.
The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission.
Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge.
When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron
from another molecule in its surroundings.
This causes a tiny nuclear reaction
in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons,
similar to X-rays,
that shoot out in opposite directions.
These photons will then impact an array
of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls.
The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors
to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred
and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution.
PET scans can detect the spread of cancer
before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging.
They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease
by allowing doctors to see amyloid,
the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed
without an autopsy.
Meanwhile, researchers are actively 
working to develop new tracers
and expand the possibilities of what 
PET scans can be used for.

But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body,
are these scans safe?
Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe,
the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low.
One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years
from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas;
or the amount a pilot would rack up
from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights.
Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable
for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.
