The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable.
Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents.
But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action
that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives
in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion.
So what is this plan,
and what exactly would it protect us from?

To create their destructive blast,
these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission–
in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two.
This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy,
and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission
are absorbed by nearby atoms,
splitting additional nuclei.
These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields,
but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT.
An explosion like this would create
a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks
and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away.

There is tragically nothing 
that can be done
to save those in the fireball’s radius.
However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond,
our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving.
And though it may sound surprising,
the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation,
is getting inside.

Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes,
getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection
from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation.
The shockwave of energy would travel
several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds.
Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave,
and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings
also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects.
Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth,
as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris
several kilometers into the atmosphere.
As the fireball cools,
unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris
to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation:
radioactive particles called fallout.

These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation,
capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms.
Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage,
radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death.
Created several kilometers up,
dangerous concentrations of this material
would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds,
potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout
in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind.

Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast
are even better at 
guarding against fallout.
Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass.
So while a broken window and sealed window
both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation,
thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth
can offer serious protection.
And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour
and 80% in the first day,
staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds
of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation.

Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter
before the fallout begins.
Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest,
they sink through the air
and collect on streets and rooftops,
making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings.
But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout,
there are still measures they could take.
After finding a safe space,
they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers,
wash any exposed skin,
and store the contaminated 
clothing far away.

Once inside,
plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours.
If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention,
try seeking outside help after an hour.
But ideally,
stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders.
While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down,
most radios would likely survive.
So listen in for emergency responders
to determine the safest course forward.

Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth,
and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures.
But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits
of getting inside.
So while we’ll hopefully never need to,
remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.
