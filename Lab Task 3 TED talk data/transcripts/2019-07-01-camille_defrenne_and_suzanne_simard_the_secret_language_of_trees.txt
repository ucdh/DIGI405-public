Most of the forest lives in the 
shadow of the giants
that make up the highest canopy.
These are the oldest trees,
with hundreds of children and 
thousands of grandchildren.
They check in with their neighbors, 
sharing food, supplies,
and wisdom gained over their long lives.

They do all this rooted in place, unable 
to speak, reach out, or move around.
The secret to their success lies 
under the forest floor,
where vast root systems support the 
towering trunks above.
Partnering with these roots are symbiotic 
fungi called mycorrhizae.

These fungi have countless branching, 
thread-like hyphae
that together make up the mycelium.
The mycelium spreads across a much larger 
area than the tree root system
and connect the roots of different 
trees together.
These connections form 
mycorrhizal networks.
Through mycorrhizal networks,
fungi can pass resources and signaling 
molecules between trees.

We know the oldest trees have the 
largest mycorrhizal networks
with the most connections to other trees,
but these connections are incredibly 
complicated to trace.
That’s because there are about a hundred 
species of mycorrhizal fungi–
and an individual tree might be colonized 
by dozens of different fungal organisms,
each of which connects to a 
unique set of other trees,
which in turn each have their own unique 
set of fungal associations.
To get a sense of how substances flow 
through this network,
let’s zoom in on sugars,
as they travel from a mature tree to a 
neighboring seedling.

Sugar’s journey starts high above 
the ground,
in the leaves of the tallest trees 
above the canopy.
The leaves use the ample sunlight up there
to create sugars through photosynthesis.
This essential fuel then travels 
through the tree
to the base of the trunk in the thick sap.

From there, sugar flows down to the roots.
Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the 
tips of the roots
and either surround or penetrate 
the outer root cells,
depending on the type of fungi.
Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they 
need them for fuel just like trees do.
They can, however,
collect nutrients from the soil much 
more efficiently than tree roots—
and pass these nutrients into 
the tree roots.
In general,
substances flow from where they are more 
abundant to where they are less abundant,
or from source to sink.
That means that the sugars flow from the 
tree roots into the fungal hyphae.
Once the sugars enter the fungus,
they travel along the hyphae through 
pores between cells
or through special hollow 
transporter hyphae.
The fungus absorbs some of the sugars,
but some travels on and enters 
the roots of a neighboring tree,
a seedling that grows in the shade and 
has less opportunity
to photosynthesize sugars.

But why does fungus transport resources 
from tree to tree?
This is one of the mysteries of the 
mycorrhizal networks.
It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil
nutrients and sugar with a tree—
both parties benefit.
The fungus likely benefits in less obvious
ways from being part of a network
between trees, but the exact ways 
aren’t totally clear.
Maybe the fungus benefits from 
having connections
with as many different trees as possible,
and maximizes its connections by shuttling
molecules between trees.
Or maybe plants reduce their 
contributions to fungi
if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges 
between trees.

Whatever the reasons,
these fungi pass an incredible amount 
of information between trees.
Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell 
when nutrients or signaling molecules
are coming from a member of their 
own species or not.
They can even tell when information is 
coming from a close relative
like a sibling or parent.
Trees can also share information 
about events like drought
or insect attacks through their 
fungal networks,
causing their neighbors to increase 
production of protective enzymes
in anticipation of threats.

The forest’s health relies on these 
intricate communications and exchanges.
With everything so deeply interconnected,
what impacts one species is bound 
to impact others.
