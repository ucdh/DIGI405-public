It was the largest contiguous land 
empire in historyâ€”
stretching from Korea to Ukraine and 
from Siberia to southern China,
and was forged on the open plains.

In the 12th century CE, before the 
Mongol Empire formed,
the East Asian steppe was home to 
scattered groups of Mongol
and Turkic pastoral nomads led by Khans.
The people herded sheep, cattle, 
yaks and camels.
They lived in felt tents and moved between
summer and winter campsites.
Nomadic women held significant authority, 

managing these migrations, 
many of the flocks and trade.
Meanwhile, men specialized in 
mounted warfare.

These nomadic groups often 
fought each other.
That was to change under Temujin, who was
born into an aristocratic Mongol family.
Despite losing his father at an early age 
and growing up in poverty,
he quickly rose to power by forging 
strategic alliances with other leaders.
Unlike those khans, Temujin promoted 
soldiers based on merit
and distributed spoils evenly 
among them.
His most brilliant move was to scatter 
the nomads he conquered
among his own soldiers so they couldn't 
join together against him.
These innovations made him unstoppable,
and by 1206, he had united the people 
of the felt-walled tents
and become Chinggis Khan.

The Mongols were shamanists,
believing that the spirits of nature 
and their ancestors
inhabited the world around them.
Over all arched the Sky god Tenggeri.
Chinggis Khan believed that Tenggeri 
wanted him to conquer the entire world
in his name.
With the nomads of the Mongolian 
plain united,
this seemed within reach.
Anyone who resisted the Mongols was 
resisting Tenggeri's will,
and for this insubordination, had to die.

Under Chinggis Khan,
the Mongols first subdued northern China 
and the eastern Islamic lands.
After his death in 1227,
the Divine Mandate passed to his family, 
or the Golden Lineage.
In the 1230s, Chinggis Khan's sons 
and daughters
conquered the Turks of Central Asia 
and the Russian princes,
then destroyed two European 
armies in 1241.
In the 1250s, the Mongols seized Islamic 
territory as far as Baghdad,
while in the East their grasp reached
southern China by 1279.

Life within the Mongol Empire wasn't just 
war, pillage and destruction.
Once the Mongols conquered a territory,
they left its internal politics alone
and used local administrators to 
govern for them.
The Mongols let all religions flourish, 
as long as the leaders prayed for them.
Although they routinely captured artisans,
scholars and engineers,
they appreciated what those 
specialists could do
and forcibly settled them across Asia 
to continue their work.
The most valuable produce in 
the Empire was gold brocade,
which took silk from China, gold from 
Tibet and weavers from Baghdad.
Gold brocade clothed the Mongol rulers, 
covered their horses
and lined their tents.
The Mongols particularly prized gunpowder 
technicians from China.
With much of Eurasia politically unified, 
trade flourished along the Silk Road,
helped by an extensive system of horse 
messengers and relay posts.
Robust trade continued at sea, especially 
in blue-and-white porcelain,
which combined white pottery from Mongol 
China with blue dye from Mongol Iran.

But this was not to last.
Succession to the Great Khan didn't 
automatically go to the eldest son,
but rather allowed brothers, uncles and 
cousins to vie for leadership
with senior widows acting as 
regents for their sons.
By the 1260s,
Chinggis Khan's grandsons were in a full-
blown civil war over inheritance
and fragmented the realm into 
four separate empires.
In China, Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty
is remembered as a golden age of 
science and culture.
In Iran, the Ilkhanate inaugurated 
the development
of new monumental architecture and 
Persian miniature painting.
In Central Asia, the Chagatai Khanate 
brought forth leaders like Timur
and his descendant Babur, who founded 
the Mughal Empire in India.
And in Eastern Europe, 
the Golden Horde ruled for years
until a trading post named Muscovy grew 
into a major world power.
Even though the Empire lasted 
only a short while,
the Mongols left a legacy of world-
domination that remains unmatched today.
