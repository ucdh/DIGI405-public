For 3 billion people around the world,
seafood provides a significant source 
of protein and nutrition.
But recent studies show that 33% of wild 
fisheries are overfished,
while another 60% are fished at their 
maximum capacity.
In fact, over half the seafood we eat–
from finfish and shellfish to 
seaweed and algae–
isn’t caught in the wild.
It’s grown through aquaculture, 
or aquatic farming.
Farmed seafood is one of the 
fastest-growing food industries,
expanding in volume by 5.8% each year.
But different methods of aquaculture come 
with different advantages and issues–
some of which echo the serious problems 
we’ve seen in industrial agriculture.
So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes
we’ve made on land, at sea?
What aquaculture approaches are we 
currently using,
and what does a sustainable way 
to farm the ocean really look like?

One of the most common aquaculture 
methods involves large pens made of nets,
where fish are farmed offshore in floating
cages roughly 1000 square meters in size.
Commonly employed off the coast of Chile
and in the fjords of Norway,
these fish, like many industrially 
farmed animals,
occupy stressful, overcrowded pens.
They produce massive amounts of waste,
polluting the surrounding areas
and potentially spreading diseases
to wild species.
Worse still, since the antibiotics 
employed to fight disease
aren’t fully absorbed by the fish,
they get excreted back 
into the environment.
Net pens are also susceptible to escapes,
unleashing huge numbers of fish which 
compete for resources
and weaken the local gene pool 
with genes adapted for captivity.
Escaped fish can even disrupt local 
ecosystems as invasive species.

Other techniques,
such as man-made coastal ponds commonly
used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia,
create additional environmental problems.
Just like net pens, these ponds are prone
to spreading pollution and disease.
Their construction also frequently 
destroys important ecosystems
like mangroves and marshes,
which protect coastal areas from storms,
provide habitats, and absorb tons 
of greenhouse gases.

One way to solve these problems is to farm
fish on land
in completely contained systems.
Tanks and raceways can recirculate and 
filter water to prevent pollution.
But even fully contained facilities still 
contend with another major hurdle:
fishmeal.
About 10% of the seafood caught globally
is used to feed animals,
including carnivorous farmed fish.
Researchers are working on fish feed made 
of insects and plant-based proteins,
but for now many inland fish farms 
are connected to overfishing.

All these obstacles can make sustainable 
aquaculture feel a long way off,
but innovative farmers are finding new 
ways to responsibly farm the seas.
The most promising solution of all 
may be to look lower on the food chain.
Instead of cramming large, carnivorous 
fish into pens,
we can work with natural ocean systems
to produce huge amounts of shellfish 
and seaweeds.
These low-maintenance flora and fauna 
don’t need to be fed at all.
In fact, they naturally improve 
water quality,
filtering it as they feed off of sunlight 
and nutrients in the seawater.
By absorbing carbon through 
photosynthesis,
these farms help battle climate change,
and reduce local ocean acidification
while creating habitats for other 
species to thrive.

Shifting to restorative ocean farming
could provide good jobs for 
coastal communities,
and support healthy plant and 
shellfish-based diets
that have an incredibly 
low carbon footprint.
In just 5 months,
4,000 square meters of ocean can 
produce 25 tons of seaweed
and 250,000 of shellfish.
With the right distribution network,
a series of small farms, collectively 
the size of Washington State
could feed the planet.
Farms like these are already popping up
around the globe,
and a new generation of farmers is 
stepping up
to pursue a more sustainable future.
Done properly,
regenerative ocean farming could play
a vital role in helping our oceans,
our climate, and ourselves.
