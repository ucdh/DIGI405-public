Billions of years ago 
on the young planet Earth
simple organic compounds assembled 
into more complex coalitions
that could grow and reproduce.
They were the very first life on Earth,
and they gave rise to every one 
of the billions of species
that have inhabited our planet since.

At the time, Earth was almost completely 
devoid
of what we’d recognize as a suitable 
environment for living things.
The young planet had widespread 
volcanic activity
and an atmosphere that created 
hostile conditions.
So where on Earth could life begin?

To begin the search for 
the cradle of life,
it’s important to first understand the 
basic necessities for any life form.
Elements and compounds essential to life
include hydrogen, methane, nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, phosphates, and ammonia.
In order for these ingredients to comingle
and react with each other,
they need a liquid solvent: water.
And in order to grow and reproduce,
all life needs a source of energy.
Life forms are divided into two camps:
autotrophs, like plants, that generate 
their own energy,
and heterotrophs, like animals, that 
consume other organisms for energy.
The first life form wouldn’t have had 
other organisms to consume, of course,
so it must have been an autotroph,
generating energy either from the sun
or from chemical gradients.

So what locations meet these criteria?
Places on land or close to the surface 
of the ocean
have the advantage of access to sunlight.
But at the time when life began,
the UV radiation on Earth’s surface
was likely too harsh for life 
to survive there.
One setting offers protection 
from this radiation
and an alternative energy source:
the hydrothermal vents that wind across
the ocean floor,
covered by kilometers of seawater 
and bathed in complete darkness.

A hydrothermal vent is a fissure 
in the Earth’s crust
where seawater seeps into magma 
chambers
and is ejected back out 
at high temperatures,
along with a rich slurry of minerals 
and simple chemical compounds.
Energy is particularly concentrated
at the steep chemical gradients 
of hydrothermal vents.

There’s another line of evidence 
that points to hydrothermal vents:
the Last Universal Common Ancestor 
of life, or LUCA for short.
LUCA wasn’t the first life form, 
but it’s as far back as we can trace.
Even so, we don’t actually know what 
LUCA looked like—
there’s no LUCA fossil, no modern-day 
LUCA still around—
instead, scientists identified genes that
are commonly found in species
across all three domains 
of life that exist today.
Since these genes are shared across 
species and domains,
they must have been inherited from 
a common ancestor.
These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived
in a hot, oxygen-free place
and harvested energy from a chemical 
gradient—
like the ones at hydrothermal vents.

There are two kinds of hydrothermal vent:
black smokers and white smokers.
Black smokers release acidic, 
carbon-dioxide-rich water,
heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius
and packed with sulphur, iron, copper,
and other metals essential to life.
But scientists now believe that black 
smokers were too hot for LUCA—
so now the top candidates for the 
cradle of life are white smokers.

Among the white smokers,
a field of hydrothermal vents on the 
Mid-Atlantic Ridge called Lost City
has become the most favored candidate 
for the cradle of life.
The seawater expelled here is highly 
alkaline and lacks carbon dioxide,
but is rich in methane and offers 
more hospitable temperatures.
Adjacent black smokers may have 
contributed the carbon dioxide necessary
for life to evolve at Lost City,
giving it all the components to support 
the first organisms
that radiated into the incredible 
diversity of life on Earth today.
