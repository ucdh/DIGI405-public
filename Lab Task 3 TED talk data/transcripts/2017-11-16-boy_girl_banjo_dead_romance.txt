(Banjo and guitar play)

(Sings) Is this what it's like
to be alive?

I reached the point of no return

and I don't know if I've been burned

from the burned bridges in my life,
thinkin' you were wrong
and I was right.

Maybe I messed up,

either way it's too late for us.

'Cause baby I'm old with regret,

wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

Can't go back to when we had a chance,

wishin' I could have a shot
at real romance.

Now I realize all the things
I could have had were in your cold hands.

I'm a fool for a dead romance.

Gone, gone, gone.

I'm a fool for a dead romance.

Gone, gone, gone.

I'm a fool for a dead romance.

Is this what it's like to fantasize

about a love that never was alive
outside my mind or distance?

With time I clearly lost my sight,

thinkin' I was wrong
to ever leave your side.

But time's the harshest judge,

makes us think we were in love.

And now
I'm old with regret,

wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

Can't go back to when we had a chance,

wishin' I could have a shot
at real romance.

Now I realize all the things
I could have had were in your cold hands.

I'm a fool for a dead romance.

Gone, gone, gone.

I'm a fool for a dead romance.
