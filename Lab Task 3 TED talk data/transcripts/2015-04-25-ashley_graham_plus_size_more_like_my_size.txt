You are bold, you are brilliant,
and you are beautiful.
There is no other woman like you.
You are capable.
Back fat, I see you popping over
my bra today, but that's alright.
I'm going to choose to love you.
And thick thighs, you are just so sexy,
you can't stop rubbing each other.
(Laughter)
That's alright. I'm going to keep you.
And cellulite, I have
not forgotten about you.
I'm going to choose to love you
even though you want to take
over my whole bottom half,
but you're a part of me.
I love you.
It's true, honestly.
I felt free once I realized
I was never going to fit the narrow mold
that society wanted me to fit in.
I was never going to be perfect enough
for an industry that defines
perfection from the outside in.
And that's OK.
Rolls, curves, cellulite, all of it.
I love every part of me.
My name is Ashley Graham,
and I'm a model and body activist.
Over the last 15 years,
I've come to the conclusion
that there is no one perfect body.
Because I, like you, possess
a wonderfully unique and diverse physique.
Now, the fashion industry
may persist to label me as "plus size",
but I like to think of it as 'my size'.
In fact, did you know
that the plus size fashion industry
actually starts at a US size 8?
And it goes up to a US size 16.
So basically what I'm saying is
that the majority of this room right now
is considered plus size.
How does it make you feel to be labeled?
I really feel like we need
to start looking
beyond the plus size model paradigms
to what it actually means
to be a model in 2015.
My journey begins in Lincoln, Nebraska.
I was 12 years old and scouted in a mall.
At 13, I signed with
a major modeling agency
and was traveling the world.
I was shooting big campaigns,
and before I even graduated high school,
I had been to multiple
different countries.
At 17, I graduated and moved to New York,
and while most kids are going through
their self-discovery stage in college,
my self discovery stage
was in the midst of catwalks,
catalogs, and casting calls.
I was working
as a full time plus size model.
Back in Nebraska, I was
known as the "Fat Model".
The girl who is pretty for a big girl.
I always hated answering that question:
"What do you do for a living?"
I would see that person's eyebrow
raise as I would reply: "I'm a model!"
I'd have to quickly qualify with:
"Well, I'm a plus size model."
In fact, here is my very first
editorial for YM Magazine.
And, you are reading it correctly,
"cantaloupes-large breasts".
I was helping women across America
at the age of 15 dress their big boobs.
But you know what the first thing
that someone in middle school
pointed out to me
besidesâ€” well, besides the obvious?
Was that fold above my knee.
That fat fold above my knee.
As a young model,
my confidence was tugged at
and pulled in all different directions.
I struggled to achieve true confidence.
I would go home and look
in front of the mirror
and only hate what I saw.
And to fill the void on the inside,
I began to cave to all the vices
being thrown my way.
Between the parties, the men, the alcohol,
I was looking for self love,
for affirmation from somebody,
when in reality, I didn't love who I was,
and I couldn't seem to get a handle
on regulating my own weight.
I began to face my insecurities head on.
And instead, I was filling
my life with temporary fixes.
I, like so many young women,
have struggled to love who I am.
And Dove's global report
on attitudes towards beauty
actually did a survey with thousands
of women in ten different countries.
And you know what
the most striking result was?
That only 2% of women
find themselves beautiful.
2%!
We need to work together to redefine
the global vision of beauty.
And it starts with becoming
your own role model.
As a curvy woman it was the assumption
that I should look up to
Marilyn Monroe or Jennifer Lopez
mainly because they were two of the most
notable curvy women in the public eye
that were being praised for their curves.
But these weren't my role models.
In reality, the woman I looked
up to the most was my mother.
She told me I was beautiful,
and she never devalued herself.
So why would I?
She told me and taught me
that true beauty comes from within
and that validation and self worth
must also come from within.
In my lowest moments of insecurity
this is when I realized
that I had to reclaim my body
and its image as my own.
Plus-size fashion is
an 18-billion-dollar industry.
And now IMG, the world's
number one modeling agency,
has signed me and other models
that are not defined by their size.
My body, like my confidence,
has been picked apart,
manipulated, and controlled by others
who didn't necessarily understand it.
I had to learn to reclaim
my body as my own.
And in reclaiming my body as my own,
I understood as a woman
that I had a greater purpose.
I had a greater purpose
to redefine beauty.
The feminine beauty.
Curvy models are becoming
more and more vocal
about the isolating nature
of the term plus size.
We are calling ourselves
what we want to be called:
women with shapes that are our own.
I believe beauty is beyond size.
With so much emphasis on
the body and external,
it's no wonder that we all
suffer so much internally.
But you know, people
in the fashion industry actually told me
that I would never be in magazines
let alone the covers of them.
Well, I guess we've proven them wrong.
Five covers in a little over a year.
And I was one of the very first
curvy models to be featured
in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Never let anybody tell you that you can't.
I have achieved, and I'm still achieving
what was seemingly impossible.
My goal is to give a voice to young women.
To give a voice
to young women who struggle
to find someone they can look up to.
For girls who struggle to look
inside the mirror and say, I love you.
For women who feel uncomfortable
expressing their confidence
they've locked away inside themselves.
For women who have relinquished
their rights to someone else.
It is critical that both men and women
create a body positive environment.
Uplift the important women in your lives.
Create a safe space for them
to express their body and their beauty
for who they are
not because of who they're not.
Be you. Be real. Be authentic.
Be your favorite kind of woman.
Don't let anybody else take that job.
And remember this is
the generation of body diversity.
The current is changing.
I now invite all of you to #TEDxBV15
with your own self-affirming words.
There may not be a full-length mirror
in front of each of you today,
but I want to challenge you
to think about what you would want
to say to yourself in the mirror
with your own self-affirming words.
Thank you.
(Applause)
