From the smallest single-celled organism
to the largest creatures on earth,
every living thing is defined 
by its genes.
The DNA contained in our genes acts like
an instruction manual for our cells.
Four building blocks called bases are 
strung together in precise sequences,
which tell the cell how to behave
and form the basis for our every trait.
But with recent advancements 
in gene editing tools,
scientists can change an organism’s
fundamental features in record time.
They can engineer drought-resistant crops
and create apples that don’t brown.
They might even prevent the spread 
of infectious outbreaks
and develop cures for genetic diseases.
CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and 
cheapest of the gene editing tools
responsible for this new wave of science.
But where did this medical 
marvel come from?
How does it work?
And what can it do?

Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a 
natural process
that’s long functioned as a 
bacterial immune system.
Originally found defending single-celled 
bacteria and archaea
against invading viruses,
naturally occurring CRISPR uses 
two main components.
The first are short snippets of 
repetitive DNA sequences
called “clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats,”
or simply, CRISPRs.
The second are Cas,
or “CRISPR-associated” proteins
which chop up DNA like molecular scissors.
When a virus invades a bacterium,
Cas proteins cut out a segment 
of the viral DNA
to stitch into the bacterium’s 
CRISPR region,
capturing a chemical snapshot 
of the infection.
Those viral codes are then copied 
into short pieces of RNA.
This molecule plays many roles 
in our cells,
but in the case of CRISPR,
RNA binds to a special protein 
called Cas9.
The resulting complexes act like scouts,
latching onto free-floating 
genetic material
and searching for a match to the virus.
If the virus invades again, the scout
complex recognizes it immediately,
and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA.

Lots of bacteria have this type 
of defense mechanism.
But in 2012, scientists figured out 
how to hijack CRISPR
to target not just viral DNA,
but any DNA in almost any organism.
With the right tools,
this viral immune system becomes a 
precise gene-editing tool,
which can alter DNA and 
change specific genes
almost as easily as fixing a typo.

Here’s how it works in the lab:
scientists design a “guide” RNA 
to match the gene they want to edit,
and attach it to Cas9.
Like the viral RNA in the 
CRISPR immune system,
the guide RNA directs Cas9 
to the target gene,
and the protein’s molecular scissors 
snip the DNA.
This is the key to CRISPR’s power:
just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short 
piece of custom guide RNA
scientists can edit practically 
any gene in the genome.

Once the DNA is cut,
the cell will try to repair it.
Typically, proteins called nucleases
trim the broken ends and 
join them back together.
But this type of repair process,
called nonhomologous end joining,
is prone to mistakes
and can lead to extra or missing bases.
The resulting gene is often unusable 
and turned off.
However, if scientists add a separate 
sequence of template DNA
to their CRISPR cocktail,
cellular proteins can perform 
a different DNA repair process,
called homology directed repair.
This template DNA is used as a blueprint 
to guide the rebuilding process,
repairing a defective gene
or even inserting a completely new one.

The ability to fix DNA errors
means that CRISPR could potentially 
create new treatments for diseases
linked to specific genetic errors, like 
cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.
And since it’s not limited to humans,
the applications are almost endless.
CRISPR could create plants 
that yield larger fruit,
mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria,
or even reprogram drug-resistant 
cancer cells.
It’s also a powerful tool 
for studying the genome,
allowing scientists to watch 
what happens when genes are turned off
or changed within an organism.

CRISPR isn’t perfect yet.
It doesn’t always make 
just the intended changes,
and since it’s difficult to predict the 
long-term implications of a CRISPR edit,
this technology raises 
big ethical questions.
It’s up to us to decide the 
best course forward
as CRISPR leaves single-celled 
organisms behind
and heads into labs, farms, hospitals,
and organisms around the world.
