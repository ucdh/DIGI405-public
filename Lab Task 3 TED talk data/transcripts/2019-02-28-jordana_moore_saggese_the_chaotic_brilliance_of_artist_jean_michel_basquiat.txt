A sky blue canvas ripped open 
by an enormous skull.
Teeth bared through visceral slashes 
of oil and spray-paint.
In 2017,
this untitled artwork was auctioned 
off for over 110 million dollars.
But it’s not the work of some old master.
These strokes of genius
belong to 21 year old 
black Brooklynite Jean-Michel Basquiat –
one of America’s most 
charismatic painters,
and currently, its highest sold.

Born in 1960 to a Haitian father 
and a Puerto Rican mother,
Basquiat spent his childhood making art 
and mischief in Boerum Hill.
While he never attended art school,
he learned by wandering 
through New York galleries,
and listening to the music 
his father played at home.

He drew inspiration from 
unexpected places,
scribbling his own versions of cartoons, 
comic books and biblical scenes
on scrap paper from his father’s office.
But it was a medical encyclopedia 
that arguably
exerted the most powerful
influence on Basquiat.
When young Jean-Michael was hit by a car,
his mother brought a copy of 
"Grey’s Anatomy" to his hospital bed.
It ignited a lifelong fascination 
with anatomy
that manifested in the skulls, 
sinew and guts of his later work –
which frequently explores both the power 
and vulnerability of marginalized bodies.

By 17, he launched his first foray into 
the art world with his friend Al Diaz.
They spray painted cryptic statements 
and symbols all over Lower Manhattan,
signed with the mysterious moniker SAMO.
These humorous, profound, 
and rebellious declarations
were strategically scattered 
throughout Soho’s art scene.
And after revealing himself as the artist,
Basquiat leveraged SAMO’s success 
to enter the scene himself;
selling postcards, playing clubs with
his avant-garde band,
and boldly seeking out his heroes.
By 21, he’d turned to painting full time.

His process was a sort of 
calculated improvisation.
Like Beat writers
who composed their work by shredding 
and reassembling scraps of writing,
Basquiat used similar cut-up techniques 
to remix his materials.
When he couldn't afford canvases,
he fashioned them out of discarded 
wood he found on the street.
He used oil stick, crayons, 
spray paint and pencil
and pulled quotes from the menus, 
comic books and textbooks
he kept open on the studio floor.

He kept these sources open 
on his studio floor,
often working on multiple 
projects at once.
Pulling in splintered anatomy, 
reimagined historical scenes,
and skulls transplanted from 
classical still-lives,
Basquiat repurposed both present day 
experiences and art history
into an inventive visual language.
He worked as if inserting himself into 
the legacy of artists he borrowed from,
producing collages that were just as 
much in conversation with art history
as they were with each other.
For instance,
"Toussaint L’Overture versus Savonarola"
and "Undiscovered Genius of the 
Mississippi Delta"
offer two distinct visions of Basquiat’s 
historical and contemporary concerns.
But they echo each other in the details,
such as the reappearing head that 
also resurfaces in "PPCD."
All these pieces form a network
that offers physical evidence
of Basquiat’s restless and prolific mind.

These chaotic canvases won 
rapid acclaim and attention.
But despite his increasingly 
mainstream audience,
Basquiat insisted on depicting 
challenging themes
of identity and oppression.
Marginalized figures take center stage, 
such as prisoners, cooks and janitors.
His obsession with bodies, history, 
and representation
can be found in works evoking the 
Atlantic slave trade and African history,
as well as pieces focusing on 
contemporary race relations.

In less than a decade,
Basquiat made thousands of 
paintings and drawings-
along with sculpture, fragments 
of poetry and music.
His output accelerated alongside 
his meteoric rise to fame,
but his life and work were 
cut tragically short
when he died from a drug overdose 
at the age of 27.
After his death,
Basquiat’s work only increased in value-
but the energy and flair of his pieces
have impacted much more than their 
financial worth.
Today, his influence swirls around us in 
music, poetry, fashion and film-
and his art retains the power to 
shock, inspire, and get under our skin.
