I'm Kelli Anderson.
I work as an artist and designer.
And I like to try to find
the hidden talents of everyday things.
So before I get started,
I want to show you a fast smattering
of some examples of what I do.
But this talk today
is really less about what I make
and is more about why I make these things.

So, I get to tinker
with everyday experiences.
As we go through our everyday lives,
visual and experiential things
exert this invisible authority
over our brains at all times.
And they yield this power
in subtle and sneaky ways.
So visuals, for example, speak volumes
through these teeny, tiny details,
codified in things like type,
shape,
color
and texture.
So these small, picky things
form the vocabulary
that come together and make the sentences,
enabling us to make
tangible things like ...
a solar-powered Popsicle truck.

(Laughter)

It educates the public
about renewable energy.
It's basically a physical
infographic on wheels.
And this unexpected pairing
of sugar, bright colors
and the threat of humanity's
self-inflicted demise
actually makes for a pretty
convincing argument for solar.

People arrive at experiences
like these with expectations.
And when we make things,
we're actively choosing
what to do with those expectations.
In my work, I want to create
disruptive wonder.
I want to confound these expectations,
because I think that every day,
fundamental things
and experiences frame reality
in a way that we often take for granted.
The small things we make
can work to reinforce
our assumptions about the world.
Or small things can come out of left field
and draw us into reassessing
our complacent expectations about reality.
This doesn't happen often,
but when it does, it's awesome.
Because then, these small things act
as sort of a humble back door
into understanding a reality
that's infinitely surprising.

So, as a little demonstration,
back to the most basic
and fundamental part of myself again:
my name, kellianderson.com,
spelled out in block letters.
This is how people find me in the world.
It means me.
But in a more objective sense,
it's really just this random
jumble of letters
that I've confined to
the single possibility of making my name.
So naturally, I wondered:
What else can these letters spell?
Turns out, all kinds
of interesting phrases, like ...
"Ken doll is near dot com."

(Laughter)

A little bit creepy.
And "A colder melon skin."
Period.

(Laughter)

Far better use of those
kellianderson.com letters,
I'm sure you'll agree.

This is a dumb game,
but it underscores a belief I have,
that the world is full of order
that doesn't necessarily
deserve our respect.
Sometimes, there's meaning, justice
and logic present in the way things are.
But sometimes there just isn't.
I think that the moment we realize this
is the moment we become creative people,
because it prompts us to mess things up
and do something better
with the basic pieces of experience.
What I'm after in my work,
really, is this:
the hidden talents of everyday things —
all of those overlooked powers
bestowed on the things that surround us
by the wonders of physics,
the complexities of cultural associations
and a gazillion other
only partially chartable things.
So today, I want to show you
three projects
that reconsider the vast properties
of commonplace experience
and try to do something better
by doing something more absurd.

This first project is a holiday card
I made for my friends.
My goal in this was
to get people to notice
this going-through-the-motions holiday
thing that I'm sure we've all felt before.
And I did that through a holiday card,
of course.
From the outside, it looks pretty normal.
But paper has this memory;
paper never forgets how it was bent.
I was able to use that material memory
to guide the recipient
through the experience of the card.
So when you first pick it up,
while floppy, it's clear it wants
to bend in all of these certain ways.
As people tinker with it,
they discover that bending the card
brings them through this simple story.
And as you can see,
it's a story about itself.

(Laughter)

This card is literally
a four-frame documentary
about receiving the card.

(Laughter)

So it's a recursive experience.

(Applause)

Oh, well, thank you.
This excites me, because it's a recursive
experience of a holiday card
that gets the viewer to feel
this repetitive ritual
of all holiday cards.
And it begins life
as a humble piece of paper
that came out of my inkjet printer.
I think that's pretty cool.

In a sense, that project was all about
ritual becoming empty gesture.
And it speaks to the fact that the more
an experience repeats itself,
the less it means —

(Laughter)

because we begin to take it for granted.
And that's why cliches aren't interesting,
and why people get in
car wrecks near their homes.
When we experience things
over and over again,
they just lose their gravity.
So while paper does have
all of these astonishing,
overlooked capabilities,
it takes a hell of a lot of intervention
into getting us to see it as new again.

This next project I want to show you
is a wedding invitation,
which is a format
practically begging for reinvention.

(Laughter)

This is a card I made
for my friends Mike and Karen,
who happen to be really awesome people.
Far more awesome, in fact,
than the format of wedding invitations.
So it was a really good excuse
to push the boundaries of this format.
And as far as how to push it,
the facts of our shared
history made it clear
that this card should be about music.
We're all total music nerds,
and Karen and Mike
have even recorded songs together.
But you know, you also find inspiration
in the darnedest of places.
And we found some
with this guy, Mr. Wizard —

(Laughter)

who had a much-beloved TV show,
teaching kids about the science
behind everyday things.
And I remembered this episode
that demonstrated sound is physical,
with this simple experiment.
He rolled up a cone of paper,
he taped it shut,
he taped a needle to the end of it,
and — voilà! — it was a record player.
I remember seeing this as a kid,
and it totally blew my mind.
If you can make a record player
out of a piece of paper
and a sewing needle,
what isn't possible out of the world?

So I explained this idea
to Mike and Karen,
and we all decided
that it would be way better
to make their guests paper record players,
rather than traditional,
boring invitations.
We started getting really, really excited.
And I started getting really nervous,
because I'm the one
who had to actually make it work.
So I began spending an inordinate amount
of time thinking about needles:
Like, would we find needles
with the right fidelity?
I started calling paper suppliers,
looking for the paper
with the best audio properties.

(Laughter)

And they thought I was crazy.

Meanwhile, Mike and Karen
were recording a song,
which they had mastered
to a clear flexi disc.
I had this black-and-white
character printed on it,
so that way, when the disc is turned,
it completes the couple
in all of these different guises.

(Laughter)

So we did it, we really did it!
We made a paper record player —
200 recipient-operated
paper record players.
This is an actual recording
of how it sounds.
And then it segues into
the real song for comparison.

(Music and singing)

(Music ends)

We were so excited
when we finally got that to work.

(Laughter)

And I was excited that we uncovered
this hidden talent of paper
in the process.

I also love that project
because it brings attention to the fact
that we approach media
with all these expectations
that we do not necessarily need.
We have assumptions
about material experience,
like that paper should be silent
or that websites should be flat.
But we also have these assumptions —

(Laughter)

that should be a lot scarier
in a democracy,
because they're like
these little thought loopholes.
We sleepwalk through our assumptions
about the authority in media
and assumptions put forth about political
realities by media, like newspapers.
But I, for one, have faith
in these small, hacked experiences
to inspire a sense of skepticism
at this limited reality we've been handed.
And this next project
demonstrates just that.

Imagine your normal, everyday
commuter-newspaper-reading ritual.
But what if you are handed a paper filled
with stories from an alternate reality?

(Laughter)

Specifically: What if some crazy person
had meticulously recreated a typical paper
depicting an alternate reality?
This is something we actually did do
in the fall of 2008,
in a project that was conceptualized
by artist Steve Lambert,
organized by The Yes Men
and executed by many, many people,
some of whom are me.
We made a perfectly counterfeited
"New York Times."
We didn't ask anyone
for permission, we just did it.

(Laughter)

We had it mass-produced,
and we put it in the hands of hundreds
of thousands of commuters
on a Thursday morning in New York City.

(Laughter)

(Applause and cheers)

Thanks!

(Applause)

"Why?," you might ask.
"Why make a fake newspaper?"
Well, quite frankly, because the real
newspaper is depressing.
We ostensibly live in a democracy
where we should have some say
in what happens in the world.
But the truth is, we never see the stories
we want to see in the newspaper.
So we made a paper with only good news.

(Laughter)

We put in all the policy ideas
we thought would actually help the world.
Years before the withdrawal
was even discussed,
we ended the war in Iraq.
Years before Occupy Wall Street,
we put in a maximum wage law —

(Laughter)

to end the ginormous wage inequities
between the lowest and highest
income earners.
We returned civics class
to high school curriculum.

(Laughter)

See? These are good ideas!
So then students would know
how their government works again.
There's a very important difference
between these two papers.

(Laughter)

While the real "New York Times"
has this slogan of,
"All the News that's Fit to Print,"
we offered a more
forward-thinking message of,
"All the News We Hope to Print."

(Laughter)

And that's because our paper is postdated
six months into the future,
so when people are handed
these on the street,
they were literally getting an artifact
from the utopian future,
sort of a blueprint
for an attainably utopian future
brought about by this very important idea
of popular pressure.

And our hoax worked perfectly.
We suspended people
in this strange mental space,
because while the stories
in the paper couldn't be real,
it just felt so perfectly,
impeccably real.
Here's a video showing —

(Laughter)

yes, we did that! —
showing the first few seconds
of conflicted belief,
where people could feel
for a moment what —

(Laughter)

Yes!

(Laughter)

This guy's good.

(Laughter)

But in order to get this type of reaction,
our paper had to be radically believable.
And Daniel Dunnam, my other half, and I
formed the believability team.
He made sure that the typography,
the layout, the smell
of the ink — everything —
was just like a real "New York Times."
And I supplied fake advertisements
from the utopian future.

(Laughter)

We decided that the utopian future
would be a perfect venue
to help these companies
who had done wrong in the past
try making amends for that wrongdoing.

(Laughter)

And we do this through the vocabulary
of their own advertising.
So for Ikea, what if
instead of cheap furniture,
you could buy your own wind farm?
It comes flat-packed,
clearly easy to assemble —

(Laughter)

with that little zigzag tool
and the wooden pegs.
That would be awesome, right?
More nefarious are companies
like De Beers,
who are making amends
for their sale of blood diamonds
by donating prosthetics
to war-torn African countries.
And this is our take
on a used car dealership ad.
They're now offering
a "cash for polluters" program.
So now you can trade in your car
for a non-polluting
type of transportation:
a bicycle!

(Laughter)

And here's my favorite, Dr. Zizmor,
who is giving you
a beautiful, clear conscience.
If you haven't taken a ride
on the New York City subway,
you may not know Dr. Z.
But if you have, then you do,
because his cheesy rainbow ads
are everywhere.
But now he is foregoing
these superficial services.
He's no longer cleaning up your face,
now he's cleaning up our mess in Iraq.

(Laughter)

So the news of our fake paper
made it onto the real news
all around the world.
These unexpected messages of hope
were able to get out there
through our sheer brazenness
in ripping off the "New York Times,"
but also because we leveraged this pathway
that no one had expected.
We pushed our paper beyond
its expected role in reporting the news,
and we made a blueprint
for a better world.

With those three projects, I demonstrate
that by rejecting normal order,
by messing things up
and by rearranging the pieces,
we can expand our notion
of what we demand from reality.
So today, I want to put forth this idea
that an avenue to better
is through a million teeny,
tiny disruptions
to whatever is sitting in front of you.
So go mess with the complacently rational.
And you can see more of my work at:
I'll snore naked dot com.

(Laughter)

Thank you.

(Applause)
