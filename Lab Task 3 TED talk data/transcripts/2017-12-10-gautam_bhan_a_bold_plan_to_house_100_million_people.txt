Shah Rukh Khan: Be it Mumbai or Delhi,
Chennai or Kolkata,
all our big cities have
one great thing in common,
they happily welcome people from 
smaller places arriving in search of work.
What is also true is that
this warm welcome leads to consequences.
Problems like housing
in these cities are born.
Today we have with us a human settlement
expert and researcher: Dr. Gautam Bhan,
who is re-imagining a solution
to this increasing problem.
He will share with us the new picture
of urban India that he can see.
TED Talks India New Thoughts
welcomes Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Dr. Gautam Bhan, everyone.

(Applause)

Gautam Bhan: In this country,
until a few years ago,
if you asked someone:
"Where are you from?"
the answer would be
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata.
You'd immediately ask again:
"Where do you belong?"
Until recently in India,
nobody was from a city;
people only migrated to the city.
This is changing.
Urbanization is changing India,
but are our cities prepared?

Let's assume you were born somewhere else.
Your parents worked as laborers all day.
Then you too would have come
to a city for progress.
Or maybe, like it happens today,
you were born in the city itself.
One day you go out looking
for an accommodation in the city,
to buy or maybe just to rent.
Will you be able find an affordable home?

The government says we are falling
short of at least 20 million homes.
20 million homes,
that's 100 million people.
And this is not the shortage of 3 BHKs
(bedroom hall kitchen).
95 percent of the shortage
is for people earning
10 to 15,000 rupees per month.
Will you be able to find
an affordable home in this budget?
If this happened with you,
what would you do?

Home is not a car
or some sort of jewellery.
Home is food and clothes.
Nobody can live without it.
If you couldn't find a home
in a city to either buy or rent,
you too would be driven to do
what most people end up doing.
Make a home wherever possible.
You too would make a settlement.
The government may keep calling it a slum,
but like the people living there,
I too will call it a settlement.

One hundred million are not homeless.
They have homes.
Homes they built on their own.
But most of these homes
are in settlements.
This is the truth
of an affordable home in India.
The homes in settlements are cheap,
but not sturdy.
The homes outside are sturdy,
but not cheap.

(Applause)

We will have to lay the foundation
of a new thought from here itself.
A settlement is not a problem;
it is a solution.
We just have to make it secure and sturdy.
To fulfill the shortage
of 20 million homes
you cannot make 20 million
25 square foot flats,
and neither should you be making them.

For example take the Karnataka government.
They have a very good record in this.
By 2020, Karnataka needs
2.6 million homes.
In the last ten years they have managed
to make 350,000 homes.
Even if a government tries
with complete sincerity,
it cannot fulfill this need
in the next couple of lifetimes.
If we do not make new homes,
then what is the next solution?
How to make a settlement secure?

Firstly, eviction needs to be stopped.
Bulldozing needs to be stopped.
Never has that resulted
in progress in the past,
nor will it in the future.

(Applause)

We have to start believing that
the laborers who build and run the city
have a right over the land of that city.

(Applause)

I know you are thinking
that settlements are made
on illegally captured land,
but capturing of land never happens
in the dead of the night.
Whether the land belongs
to the government or not,
a settlement is never formed secretly.
It is inhabited over time.
The government also agrees that
the settlements in our cities have been
there for over 10, 20, 30, even 40 years.
What kind of
illegally captured land is this,
which was ignored for 30 years
and suddenly a day before eviction
is declared illegal?
A settlement can easily accommodate
15 to 60 percent of a city's population
by using just one, two
or maximum ten percent of the land.
Can such a huge number of people not have
a right over this small bit of land?

A city's progress is often measured
by the cost of its land.
How do you ascribe a cost to the life
of a person living on a piece of land?
A settlement is not asking you
for shiny homes;
all it's asking for is basic necessities:
electricity, roads, water,
toilets and drainage.
We call this upgradation.
Here's an example of upgradation.
In Ahmedabad, they started a program
where for ten years, 44 settlements were
promised there wouldn't be any eviction.
Only a promise.
Nothing written, no documents.
And basic necessities
were provided to them.
In ten years that slum changed into
a locality, a place, a world of its own.
The government didn't have to build
even a single new home.

(Applause)

Thailand launched this program
at national scale,
benefiting 100,000 people in 137 cities.
And every person was given the right
to live over that land.
But pay attention here.
Not the right to sell,
but the right to live there,
use it, settle on it.
The whole world knows now
that to move forward,
we cannot remove settlements.
We can only advance when we think of ways
to make settlements secure and sturdy.
But just one thing.
If we know it, then why doesn't it happen?

To apply this new thinking to settlements,
we, that is you and me,
need to look deep within
and get rid of the disgust, disrespect
and apprehensions that we have.
Actually I should not be standing
here in front of you today.
A person from the settlement who lives
there should be standing here.
But if someone like that came here,
you wouldn't have listened to him.
You are listening to me, because you think
I am not from a settlement.
This is the very thought
that needs to be changed.

Thank you.

(Applause)
SRK: Thank you very much.
Thank you, Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Thanks a lot.

Please tell me, you just gave
an example of Thailand
and the big thing there is
the homes are for people
to settle in, not to sell.
They cannot be used for sale.
Is there a similar thought process
or program in our country too,
inspired by your talks
and those of people around you?

GB: I wouldn't say by me,
but by the people movement
who are fighting for rights in the city.
That is making a difference.
For instance, in Odisha
the Chief Minister, Mr. Patnaik,
announced the same scheme:
that all the people in settlements
will have rights over that land.

(Applause)

And I think this scheme
shouldn't be called populism;
it should be called an economic
development strategy.
Because economic development does not
happen from the top, but from the bottom.

(Applause)

SRK: I too promise
I will only say settlements,
and not slums, ever again. 100 percent.

(Applause)

Dr. Bhan you came here and said such
wonderful things.
There is a song. I will not sing it,
as I am a terrible singer.

GB: I too am a terrible singer.

SRK: But we can't keep shut also,
because we are saying wonderful things.
(laughter)
So we will just say it.
Slowly the heart will find settlement.
GB: Slowly the heart will find settlement.
SRK: Only then will life be filled
with love and fun times.

(Applause)

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Thank you.

(Applause)

Thank you very much.
