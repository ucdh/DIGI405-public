Take a look at this image.
What might this be?
A frightening monster?
Two friendly bears?
Or something else entirely?
For nearly a century,
ten inkblots like these have been used
as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test.
Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients,
the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind.
But what can inkblots really tell us,
and how does this test work?

Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach,
the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see,
and more about our general approach 
to perception.
As an amateur artist
Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person.
He carried this interest to 
medical school,
where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected.
He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs,
but transforms them.
And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland,
he began designing a series 
of puzzling images
to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process.

Using his inkblot paintings,
Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects
and psychiatric patients with 
the same question:
what might this be?
However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach,
but rather, how they approached the task.
Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore?
Did they see the image moving?
Did the color on some inkblots help them 
give better answers,
or distract and overwhelm them?

He developed a system to code 
people’s responses,
reducing the wide range of interpretations
to a few manageable numbers.
Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers:
the creative and imaginative,
the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers,
and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach.
Some people would get stuck,
offering the same answer 
for multiple blots.
Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions.
Responses were as varied as the inkblots,
which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems–
some easier to interpret than others.
But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach
yielded real insights into 
their psychology.
And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people,
patterns began to pile up.
Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities
often took remarkably similar approaches.
Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses
also performed similarly,
making the test a reliable 
diagnostic tool.
It could even diagnose some conditions
difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods.

In 1921,
Rorschach published his coding system 
alongside the ten blots he felt
gave the most nuanced picture of people’s
perceptual approach.
Over the next several decades,
the test became wildly popular in 
countries around the world.
By the 1960s,
it had been officially administered 
millions of times in the U.S. alone.
Unfortunately, less than a year after 
publishing the test,
Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly.
Without its inventor to keep it on track,
the test he had methodically gathered 
so much data to support
began to be used in all sorts 
of speculative ways.

Researchers gave the test 
to Nazi war criminals,
hoping to unlock the psychological roots 
of mass murder.
Anthropologists showed the images to 
remote communities
as a sort of universal personality test.
Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions
based on reductive decoding charts.
As the test left clinics and entered 
popular culture
its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted,
and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use.

Today, the test is still controversial,
and many people assume 
it has been disproven.
But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research
showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results,
which can help diagnose mental illness
or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile.
It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind–
no test is.
But its visual approach and lack 
of any single right answer
continue to help psychologists paint
a more nuanced picture
of how people see the world.
Bringing us one step closer
to understanding the patterns 
behind our perceptions.
