In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE,
the bishop and the governor 
were in a fight.
It started with a disagreement over the 
behavior of a militia of monks,
and ended with an accusation 
of witchcraft
leveled against one of the most 
powerful figures in the city.

Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent 
mathematician, philosopher,
and advisor to the city’s leaders.
In the centuries since she lived,
the details of her life have been 
the subject of much dispute
and have taken on an almost 
mythical status.
But while none of Hypatia’s 
own writings survive,
her contemporaries’ and students’ 
accounts of her work and life
paint a picture of the qualities that 
made her renowned as a scholar,
beloved as a teacher, and ultimately 
led to her downfall.

Hypatia was born around 
355 in Alexandria,
then part of the Egyptian province 
of the Eastern Roman Empire,
and an intellectual center.
Her father Theon was an accomplished 
Greek mathematician and astronomer;
her mother is unknown.
Hypatia was likely an only child, and 
Theon educated her himself.
By adulthood, she had surpassed her 
father in both mathematics and philosophy,
becoming the city’s foremost scholar 
and taking over his position
at the head of the Platonic school, 
similar to a modern university.
She refined scientific instruments, 
wrote math textbooks,
and developed a more efficient 
method of long division.

But perhaps her most significant 
contributions to intellectual life
in Alexandria came through her teaching.

The philosophy Hypatia taught drew 
from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle,
as well as the mystical philosopher 
Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras.
The convergence of these influences merged
to form a school called Neoplatonism.
For the Neoplatonists, mathematics 
had a spiritual aspect,
divided among the four branches of 
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.
These subjects were not studied merely 
for the sake of curiosity
or practical utility, but because they 
authenticated the belief
that numbers were the sacred 
language of the universe.
In the repeated patterns of algebraic 
formulas and geometric shapes,
the orbits of the planets, and the 
harmonious intervals of musical tones,
the Neoplatonists saw a rational 
cosmic force at work.
Students delved into this ordered 
mathematical world
to achieve higher unity with this force, 
known as “the One.”

While Hypatia was considered pagan—
a term for traditional Roman 
belief before Christianity—
she worshipped no particular 
deity or deities,
and her ideas could be applied alongside 
multiple religious viewpoints.
Jewish and Christian as well 
as pagan students
travelled from the farthest reaches of 
the empire to study with her.
The nonpartisan environment 
Hypatia fostered,
where all students could feel comfortable,
was especially remarkable given the 
religious and political turmoil
that was fracturing the city of 
Alexandria at the time.

Christianity had recently become 
the Empire’s state religion.
The local archbishop Cyril had steadily 
gained political power,
commanding zealous militias of Christian 
monks to destroy pagan temples
and harass the Jewish population.
In doing so, he encroached on the secular
authority of the Roman governor Orestes,
himself a moderate Christian, leading to
a bitter public feud between the two men.

Because she was seen as a wise 
and impartial figure,
governor Orestes consulted Hypatia,
who advised him to act with 
fairness and restraint.
But when a group of Cyril’s 
monks incited a riot,
badly injuring Orestes in the process, 
he had their leader tortured to death.
Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia,
accusing her of witchcraft to 
turn Orestes against Christianity.
In March 415, as Hypatia was 
traveling through the city,
the bishop’s militia of monks 
dragged her from her carriage
and brutally murdered and dismembered her.

Hypatia’s death was a turning point 
in the politics of Alexandria.
In the wake of her murder,
other philosophers in the Greek 
and Roman tradition fled,
and the city’s role as a center of 
learning declined.
In a very real way,
the spirit of inquisition, openness, 
and fairness she fostered
died with her.
