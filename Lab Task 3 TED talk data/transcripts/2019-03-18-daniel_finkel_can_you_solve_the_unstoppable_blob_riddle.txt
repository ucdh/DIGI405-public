A shooting star crashes on Earth,
and a hideous blob emerges.
It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides.
It’s also unstoppable:
weapons, fire, extreme temperatures…
no matter what you throw at it,
it just regrows and continues its rampage.

Its expansion is breathtaking;
it doubles in size every hour.
But there’s one opportunity:
after each hour, it goes to sleep,
forming itself into a flat triangle
and resting for a few minutes
before it begins eating and growing again.

Your only chance to save the planet
involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission
ray that can cut through the blob.
When the blog is active
it heals itself within seconds.
However, when you break the sleeping 
blob into two triangles,
you make a critical discovery.
The acute triangle portion,
with all angles less than 90 degrees, 
is inert.
It never “wakes up.”
The obtuse triangle,
which has an angle greater 
than 90 degrees,
wakes up as usual and keeps growing.
Similar experiments show that all shapes 
other than acute triangles,
including right triangles, 
will also wake up.

For the next few minutes,
the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form.
You can make clean, straight-line cuts
between any two points 
on or inside the triangle.
But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you.
By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns,
the blob will have consumed 
the entire world,
if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains.

How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles
and stop it from destroying the planet?

While this seems doable at first,
there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles.
Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge,
it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles.

That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles.
But as with so many of life’s problems,
we can look to pizza for inspiration.
Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza,
so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon.
When we cut it into slices,
each of the eight triangles is acute.
This works with larger polygons too.
Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides,
including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons.
That’s good news,

because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle,
a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with.
And just like a pizza,
you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles.
That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert.
You’ve saved the day!
Now you just need to figure out what to do
with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.
