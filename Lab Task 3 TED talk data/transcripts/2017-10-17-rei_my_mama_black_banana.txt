I've been looking

Several days now

Where did they go?

Where did they go?

My mama told me long ago

I've lost so many precious things, I know

They won't be back

Where did they go?

My mama told me long ago

Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to abandon my old friend

Happy days, walking on the shore

Happy days, walking on the shore

Happy days, walking on the shore

Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to abandon my good memories at all

I've seen so many pretty things

They don't mean a thing now

Listen to the song

My mama told me long ago

Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to doubt my good old days

Happy days, walking on the shore

Happy days, walking on the shore

Happy days, walking on the shore

Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to abandon my good memories at all

Abandon my good memories at all

Abandon my good memories at all

Thank you.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity
to perform tonight at TED New York.
I've been a dedicated TED fan and viewer,
and also, I actually used to live
in Manhattan when I was younger,
so New York is like a second home to me,
and it's great to be back.
The song I just performed
was called "my mama,"
and the next song I'm going to perform
is another original song of mine
called "BLACK BANANA."
This song I wrote about the importance
of being patient with your dreams.
Because I think commitment
will always be rewarded.
Just like fruit ripens
when the time is right.
So it's my interpretation
of building the future.

Clap your hands.

One!
Two!
One, two, one, two, three, four.

Sitting here, killing time,
I've been doing it all day

I've been always smart
when it comes to gettin' away

Got a soda pop fizzin' hard
in my empty brain

When the time is right I'll move
alright so don't get too uptight

Silly girls in bathing suits
cleaning cars on Sundays

They're living a lie
don't make as fool of yourself too soon

Lining my bananas
on the window sill to ripen

When the time is right I'll move
alright so don't get too uptight

Bananananana sekasanaide

Bananananana-ri yuki makase

Bananananana mō ato
chotto dake jukusu made

Black Banana Black Banana

Banananananana

Remember last December
when we went to get some pizza

Was a brat, was running fast
to get home by my curfew

Silly me, tripping quick,
I was almost killed by a honker

When the time is right I'll move
alright so don't get too uptight

Bananananana isoganaide

Bananananana-ri yuki makase

Bananananana mō ato
chotto dake jukusu made

Black Banana Black Banana

Banananananana

Bananananana Don't push me baby

Bananananana All I want is leeway

Bananananana You gotta be patient
for the fruit to ripen

Black Banana Black Banana

Banananana

Bananananana isoganaide

Bananananana-naru yoni nare

Bananananana wagamamana mi ga jukusu made

Black Banana Black Banana

Bananananana

Bananananana
