The greatest challenge a vampire hunter 
can take on
is to bring sunlight 
into a vampire's lair.
You’ve stealthily descended into the 
darkness of a vampire cave,
setting a sequence of mirrors as you go.
When the sun reaches 
the right angle in the sky,
a focused beam of light will ricochet 
along the mirrors,
strike your diffuser,
and illuminate the great chamber 
where the vampires sleep.

You set the final mirror
and sneak through an opening 
in the corner of the great chamber.
The diffuser must be wall-mounted,
but the walls are crowded with coffins,
which you don’t dare disturb.
The only open spots are in the other 
three corners of the room.

The light will enter through the southwest
corner at a 45 degree angle
and bounce off the perfectly smooth 
metallic walls
until it hits one of the 
other three corners.
But which corner will it hit?
You know the room is a rectangle 49 meters
wide and 78 meters long.

You could probably find the answer
by drawing a scale model of the room 
and tracing the path of the light,
but the sun will be in its 
place in just minutes,
and you’ve got no time to spare.
Fortunately, there’s a different way
to solve this puzzle
that’s both simple and elegant.

So in which corner should 
you place the diffuser
to flood the vampire lair with sunlight?

it out for yourself.

You could tackle this problem 
by examining smaller rooms,
and you’d find a lot 
of interesting patterns.
But there’s one insight that can unravel 
this riddle in almost no time at all.

Let’s draw the chamber 
on a coordinate grid,
with the Southwest corner 
at the point (0,0).
The light passes through grid points
with coordinates that are either 
both even or both odd.
This is true even after it bounces off 
one or more walls.
Another way of thinking about it is this:
since the light travels at a 
45 degree angle,
it always crosses the diagonal 
of a unit square.
Traveling 1 meter horizontally 
changes the x coordinate
from even to odd or vice versa.
Traveling 1 meter vertically 
changes the y coordinate
from even to odd or vice versa.
Traveling diagonally – as the light 
does here – does both at once,
so the x and y coordinates of any points 
the light passes through
must be both even, or both odd.
This observation is more 
powerful than it seems.
In particular, it means that we have a 
way to identify the kinds of points
the light won’t ever go through
If one of the coordinates is even 
and the other is odd,
the light will miss them.
That means it’ll miss the top 
two corners of the room,
since those points have one even 
and one odd coordinate.
The Southeast corner is the 
only option for the diffuser.

And indeed, when that precious 
beam of sunlight enters the hall,
it bounces between the walls
and strikes the Southeast corner, spot on.
The vampires, sensing the intrusion,
burst from their coffins 
and turn to dust in the light.
It was a “high stakes” test,
and you passed with flying colors.
