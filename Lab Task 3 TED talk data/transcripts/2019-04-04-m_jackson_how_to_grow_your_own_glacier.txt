In the 13th Century,
Genghis Khan embarked on a mission
to take over Eurasia,
swiftly conquering countries and drawing 
them into his expanding Mongol Empire.
With his vast armies he became almost 
unstoppable.
But, legend has it that there was 
one obstacle
that even the impressive Khan couldn’t 
overcome:
A towering wall of ice,
grown by locals across a mountain pass
to stop the Khan’s armies from 
invading their territory.

No one knows how historically accurate 
that particular story is,
but remarkably, it draws on fact:
For centuries, in the Karakoram 
and Himalayan mountain ranges,
people have been growing glaciers 
and using these homemade bodies of ice
as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops.
But before we get to that fascinating 
phenomenon,
it’s important to understand the 
difference between
glaciers that grow in the wild,
and those that humans create.

In the wild,
glaciers require three conditions to grow:
Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time.
First, a great deal of snow falls and 
accumulates.
Cold temperatures then ensure that the 
stacked up snow
persists throughout the winter, spring, 
summer, and fall.
Over the following years, decades, 
and centuries,
the pressure of the accumulated snow
transforms layers into highly compacted 
glacial ice.

Artificially growing a glacier,
however, is completely different.
At the confluence of three great 
mountain ranges,
the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush,
some local cultures have believed for
centuries that glaciers are alive.
And what’s more,
that certain glaciers can have different 
genders including male and female.
Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers
by grafting together—or marrying—
fragments of ice from male and 
female glaciers,
then covering them with charcoal, 
wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches
so they can reproduce.
Under their protective coverings,
these glacierets transform into fully 
active glaciers
that grow each year with 
additional snowfall.
Those then serve as lasting 
reserves of water
that farmers can use 
to irrigate their crops.

These practices have spread 
to other cultures,
where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers
and applying them to solve serious 
modern challenges around water supplies.
Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region
in northern India.
It sits in the rain shadow of the 
Himalayas
and receives on average fewer than ten 
centimeters of rain per year.
As local glaciers shrink because 
of climate change,
regional water scarcity is increasing.
And so, local people have started growing 
their own glaciers
as insurance against this uncertainty.
These glaciers come in two types: 
horizontal, and vertical.

Horizontal glaciers are formed when 
farmers redirect glacier meltwater
into channels and pipes,
then carefully siphon it off into a series
of basins made from stones and earth.
Villagers minutely control the release of 
water into these reservoirs,
waiting for each new layer to freeze
before filling the basin 
with another wave.
In early spring,
these frozen pools begin to melt,
supplying villagers with 
irrigation for their fields.

Local people make vertical glaciers using 
the meltwater
from already-existing glaciers 
high above their villages.
The meltwater enters channels 
that run downhill,
flowing until it reaches a crop site
where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing
straight into the air.
When winter temperatures dip,
this water freezes as it arcs 
out of the pipe,
ultimately forming a 50 meter ice 
sculpture called a stupa,
shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone.
This inverted form minimizes the amount
of surface area it exposes to the sun
in the spring and summer.
That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly
and provides a reliable supply of water 
to feed the farmers’ crops.

These methods may be ancient,
but they’re becoming more relevant
as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet.
In fact, people are now growing their own
glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh.
Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier 
growing technology,
created their first stupa in 2016 
in the Swiss Alps.
There are plans for over 100 more in 
villages in Pakistan,
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.
Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness
our homegrown glaciers
well enough to build whole walls of ice–
this time not for keeping people out,
but to enable life in some of the planet’s
harshest landscapes.
