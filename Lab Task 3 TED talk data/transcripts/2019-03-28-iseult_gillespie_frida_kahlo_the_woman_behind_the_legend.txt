In 1925,
Frida Kahlo was on her way home 
from school in Mexico City
when the bus she was riding 
collided with a streetcar.
She suffered near-fatal injuries 
to her spine, pelvis and hips,
and was bedridden for months afterward.

During her recovery,
she had a special easel 
attached to her bed
so she could practice 
painting techniques.
When she set to work,
she began to paint the world according 
to her own singular vision.
Over the course of her life,
she would establish herself as the creator
and muse behind extraordinary art.

Though you may have met 
Kahlo's gaze before,
her work provides an opportunity 
to see the world through her eyes.
She painted friends and family,
still lives and spiritual scenes;
but it was her mesmerizing self-portraits
which first caught the world’s attention.

In an early work,
"Self Portrait with Velvet Dress,"
the focus is on her strong brows, facial 
hair, long neck and formidable stare.
Such features remained,
but Kahlo soon began to present herself 
in more unusual ways.
For example,
"The Broken Column" uses symbolism,
religious imagery and a ruptured landscape
to reveal her physical and mental state.

In 1928, Kahlo started dating 
fellow painter Diego Rivera.
They became lifelong partners and 
cultivated an eccentric celebrity.
Together, they traveled the world and 
dedicated themselves to art,
Communist politics and 
Mexican nationalism.

Kahlo and Rivera shared a 
deep affinity with Mexicanidad,
a movement which celebrated indigenous 
culture after the Revolution.
In her daily life, Kahlo wore 
traditional Tehuana dress
and immersed herself 
in native spirituality.
And in her work,
she constantly referenced 
Mexican folk painting,
incorporating its bright colors
and references to death, 
religion and nature.

With her imagery of giant 
floating flowers,
undulating landscapes, transplanted body 
parts and billowing clouds of demons,
Kahlo has often been associated 
with Surrealism.
But while surrealists used dreamlike 
images to explore the unconscious mind,
Kahlo used them to represent her 
physical body and life experiences.

Two of her most-explored experiences
were her physical disabilities 
and her marriage.
As a result of the bus accident,
she experienced life-long health 
complications
and endured many hospitalizations.
She often contemplated the physical and 
psychological effects
of disability in her work;
painting herself in agony,
recuperating from operations,
or including objects such as her back
brace and wheelchair.

Meanwhile, her relationship with Rivera
was tempestuous,
marked by infidelity on both sides.
At one point they even divorced,
then remarried a year later.
During this period,
she painted the double self-portrait 
"The Two Fridas,"
which speaks to the anguish of loss 
and a splintered sense of self.

The Frida to the left has a broken heart,
which drips blood onto her 
old-fashioned Victorian dress.
She symbolizes a version of the artist 
who is wounded by the past–
but is also connected by an 
artery to a second self.
This Frida is dressed in Tehuana attire–
and although she remembers Diego 
with the tiny portrait in her hand,
her heart remains intact.
Together, the two suggest a position 
caught between past and present,
individuality and dependency.

Kahlo died in 1954 at the age of 47.
In the years after her death,
she experienced a surge in popularity 
that has lasted to this day.
And although her image has proliferated,
Kahlo’s body of work
reminds us that there are no simple truths
about the life, work and legacy of the 
woman behind the icon.
Rather, she put multiple versions of 
her reality on display–
and provided us with a few entry-ways 
into the contents of her soul.
