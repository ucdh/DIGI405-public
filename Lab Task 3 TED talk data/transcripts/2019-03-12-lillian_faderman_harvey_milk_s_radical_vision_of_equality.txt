By 1973,
Harvey Milk had already been many things:
naval officer, high school teacher,
bit-part actor, and wandering hippie.
But as he embarked on yet another life 
running a camera shop in San Francisco,
he already found himself distracted.
From the Watergate hearings 
on national news,
to the teacher who had to rent a projector
when her school couldn’t afford one,
Harvey saw a desperate need 
for political reform.

Milk strongly believed that tight knit 
neighborhoods
were essential to the fabric of the city,
and that government should solve those 
community’s most practical problems.
From fixing potholes and putting 
up stop signs,
to promoting a friendly culture 
of cooperation,
Milk envisioned a more personal 
approach to local government.

This philosophy led him to run 
for the city’s Board of Supervisors
as the representative 
for his own district,
which included the heart of 
American gay culture,
the Castro.
At this time, police brutality, 
discrimination and media stereotyping
plagued the LGBT community,
labeling Harvey and his supporters as 
political outsiders.
But Milk refused to 
downplay his sexuality.
He was sure that gay rights could never 
be won from the closet,
and he saw the Castro
as one of many minorities without 
representation in city politics.
Milk was determined to bring these 
basic government services
to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised 
groups,
regardless of race, age, or sexuality.

But despite his flair for public speaking
and open-hearted approach,
voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision.
In 1973, he lost his first bid for 
the Board of Supervisors.
In 1975, he lost again.
A year later, he ran for the California 
Assembly– and lost.
Yet he tirelessly continued 
to support his district,
befriending bartenders, construction 
unions, and local Chinese grocers.
This earned him the affectionate title, 
the "mayor of Castro Street.”
And when he ran his third campaign for 
the Board of Supervisors in 1977,
Harvey finally won the seat–
becoming one of the first openly gay 
public officials in US history.

Elated, Milk arrived in office determined 
to make lasting change.
He immediately introduced a bill outlawing
discrimination on the grounds of sexuality
and launched a major clean-up of the city.
But not everyone was happy 
with this direction.
Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national 
momentum,
especially in the form of 
California’s Proposition 6.

The proposition, which sought 
to make it illegal
for homosexuals to work 
in Californian schools,
would prove to be the biggest battle 
of Milk’s career.
Supporters of Prop 6 attacked 
the LGBT community,
calling them unfit to work with students.
But Milk urged them not to hide in fear:
“Come out to your relatives.
Come out to your friends, 
if indeed they are your friends.
Come out to your neighbors, 
to your fellow workers…
break down the myths.
Destroy the lies and distortions.
For your sake. For their sake.”
Alongside other activists,
he ran an incandescent campaign 
against hate.

On November 7, 1978,
Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide.
It was proof that Milk’s message was 
gaining traction.
But just twenty days after this 
inspiring victory,
he was assassinated at City Hall–
killed alongside San Francisco 
Mayor George Moscone.

Both men had been murdered by Dan White,
a former fellow supervisor,
who had positioned himself against those 
he called "radicals, social deviates
and incorrigibles.”
He had frequently clashed with Harvey 
at Board meetings,
and resented the spirit of change 
which Milk personified for many.
The night of Milk's murder,
thousands marched by candlelight 
through the city.

In the wake of this tragedy,
yet another injustice arose.
In a highly controversial verdict,
White received a sentence of only seven 
years and eight months–
a decision that sparked uproar 
throughout the city
in what became known as 
the White Night Riots.

But even after his death,
Milk continued to preach 
his hopeful cause.
He left his friends and followers a total 
of three different tapes
to be played in the event 
of his assassination.
They leave us with a call to action,
and a reminder that everyone is welcome
in the fight against injustice:
"I ask for the movement to continue…
and if a bullet should enter my brain,
let that bullet destroy 
every closet door…”
