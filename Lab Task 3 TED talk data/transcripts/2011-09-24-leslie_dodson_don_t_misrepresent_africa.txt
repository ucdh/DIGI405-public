I just want to start with a little bit
of a word of warning, and that is:
my job here tonight is to be
a little bit of a "doctor bring-me-down."
So bear with me for a few minutes,
and know that after this,
things will get lighter and brighter.
So let's start.

I know that many of you have heard
the traveler's adage,
"Take nothing but pictures,
leave nothing but footprints."
Well, I'm going to say
I don't think that's either as benign
nor as simple as it sounds,
particularly for those of us in industries
who are portraying people
in poor countries,
in developing countries
and portraying the poor.
And those of us in those industries
are reporters, researchers
and people working for NGOs;
I suspect there are a lot of us
in those industries in the audience.
We're going overseas
and bringing back pictures like this:
of the utterly distressed
or the displaced
or the hungry
or the child laborers
or the exotic.

Now, Susan Sontag reminds us
that photographs, in part, help define
what we have the right to observe,
but more importantly,
they are an ethics of seeing.
And I think right now is a good time
to review our ethics of seeing,
as our industries of reporting
and research and NGO work
are collapsing and changing,
in part, by what's being driven by
what's happening in the economy.
But it's making us forge
new relationships.
And those new relationships
have some fuzzy boundaries.
I worked at the edge
of some of these fuzzy boundaries,
and I want to share with you
some of my observations.

My ethics of seeing is informed
by 25 years as a reporter
covering emerging economies
and international relations.
And I believe in a free
and independent press.
I believe that journalism
is a public good.
But it's getting harder to do that job,
in part, because of the massive layoffs,
because the budgets for international
reporting aren't there anymore,
new technologies and new platforms
begging new content,
and there are a lot of new journalisms.
There's activist journalism,
humanitarian journalism, peace journalism,
and we are all looking to cover
the important stories of our time.
So we're going to NGOs and asking them
if we can embed in their projects.
This is in part because they're doing
important work in interesting places.

That's one example here:
this is a project I worked on
in the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.
NGOs understand the benefits
of having reporters tag along
on their team.
They need the publicity,
they are under tremendous pressure,
they're competing in a very crowded
market for compassion.
So they're also looking to reporters
and to hire freelance reporters
to help them develop
their public relations material
and their media material.
Now, researchers are also under pressure.
They're under pressure to communicate
their science outside of the academy.
So they're collaborating with reporters,
because for many researchers,
it's difficult for them
to write a simple story or a clear story.
And the benefit for reporters
is that covering field research
is some of the best work out there.
You not only get to cover science,
but you get to meet
interesting scientists,
like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling,
she, of the magic research
high tops there.
And it was a discussion with Revi
that brought us to the edge
of the researcher and reporter,
that fuzzy boundary.
And I said to her,
"I was looking forward
to going to developing countries
and doing research and covering stories
at the same time."
She said, "I don't think so, girlfriend."
And that confusion, that mutual confusion,
drove us to publish a paper
on the conflicting ethics
and the contradictory practices
of research and reporting.
We started with the understanding
that researchers and reporters
are distant cousins,
equally storytellers and social analysts.
But we don't see nor portray
developing communities the same way.

Here's a very classic example.
This is Somalia, 1992.
It could be Somalia today.
And this is a standard operating procedure
for much of the news video
and the news pictures that you see,
where a group of reporters
will be trucked in,
escorted to the site of a disaster,
they'll produce their material,
take their pictures, get their interviews,
and then they'll be escorted out.
This is decidedly not a research setting.

Now, sometimes, we're working
on feature stories.
This is an image I took of a woman
in Bhongir Village
in Andhra Pradesh in India.
She's at a microfinance meeting.
It's a terrific story.
What's important here
is that she is identifiable.
You can see her face.
This also is not a research picture.
This is much more representative
of a research picture.
It's a research site: you see young women
accessing new technologies.
It's more of a time stamp,
it's a documentation of research.
I couldn't use this for news.
It doesn't tell enough,
and it wouldn't sell.

But then, the differences
are even deeper than that.
Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates
that researchers are under.
They are under some very strict rules
governed by their university
research review boards
when it comes to content
and confidentiality.
Researchers are mandated to acquire
document-informed consent.
Well, as a reporter, if I hang
a microphone on someone,
that is consent.
And when it comes to creating the story,
I'll fact-check as a reporter,
but I don't invite company
to create that story,
whereas social scientists, researchers,
and particularly
participatory researchers,
will often work on constructing
the narrative with the community.
And when it comes
to paying for information,
"checkbook journalism"
is roundly discouraged,
in part, because of the bias it introduces
in the kind of information you get.
But social scientists understand
that people's time is valuable
so they pay them for that time.

So while journalists are well-placed
to convey the beauty
of the scientific process —
and I would add, the NGO process —
what about the warts?
What happens if a research project
is not particularly well-designed,
or an NGO project
doesn't fulfill its goals?
Or the other kind of warts,
you know, what happens after dark
when the drinks happen.
Research environments
and reporting trips and NGO projects
are very intimate environments;
you make good friends
while you're doing good work.
But there's a little bit
of Johnnie Walker journalism after dark,
and what happens to that line
between embedded
and in-bedded?
Or what do you do with the odd
and odious behavior?
The point is that you'll want
to negotiate in advance
what is on the record
and off the record.

I'm going to turn now to some NGO imagery
which will be familiar
to some of you in this audience.

(Video) Narrator: For about 70 cents,
you can buy a can of soda,
regular or diet.
In Ethiopia, for just 70 cents a day,
you can feed a child like Jamal
nourishing meals.
For about 70 cents,
you can also buy a cup of coffee.
In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day,
you can help a child like Vilma get
the clothes she needs to attend school.

Leslie Dodson: Now, there's
some very common imagery
that's been around for 40 years.
That's part of Sally Struthers's
famine campaign.
Some of it is very familiar;
it's the Madonna and child.
Women and children are very effective
in terms of NGO campaigns.
We've been looking at this imagery
for a long time,
for hundreds and hundreds of years;
the Madonna and child.
Here is [Duccio],
and here is Michelangelo.
My concern is: Are we
one-noting the genders
in our narratives of poverty
in developing communities?
Do we have women as victims,
and are men only the perpetrators?
Are they the guys with the AK-47s
or the boy soldiers?
Because that doesn't leave
room for stories
like the man who's selling ice cream
at the refuge camp in Southern Sudan,
where we did a project,
or the stories of the men who are working
on the bridge over the Blue Nile.
So I wonder:
Are these stories inconvenient
to our narratives?

And what about this narrative?
This is a for-profit game,
and its aim is to make development fun.
One question is: Did they
inadvertently make fun of?
Another set of questions is:
What are the rights of these children?
What rights of publicity
or privacy do they have?
Did they get paid?
Should they get paid?
Should they share in the profit?
This is a for-profit game.
Did they sign talent waivers?
I have to use these
when I'm working with NGOs
and documentary filmmakers
here in the States.
In the States, we take our right
to privacy and publicity
very seriously.
So what is it about getting
on a long-haul flight
that makes these rights vaporize?

I don't want to just pick on our friends
in the gaming arts;
I'll turn to the graphic arts,
where we often see these monolithic,
homogeneous stories
about the great country of Africa.
But Africa is not a country,
it's a continent.
It's 54 countries and thousands
and thousands of languages.
So my question is:
Is this imagery productive,
or is it reductive?
I know that it's popular.

USAID just launched
their campaign "Forward" —
FWD: Famine, War and Drought.
And by looking at it, you would think
that was happening all the time,
all over Africa.
But this is about what's happening
in the Horn of Africa.
And I'm still trying to make sense
of Africa in a piece of Wonder Bread.
I'm wondering about that.

Germaine Greer has wondered
about the same things and she says,
"At breakfast and at dinner,
we can sharpen our own appetites
with a plentiful dose
of the pornography of war, genocide,
destitution and disease."
She's right. We have
sharpened our appetites.
But we can also sharpen our insights.
It is not always war,
insurrection and disease.
This is a picture out of South Sudan,
just a couple of months
before the new country was born.

I will continue to work as a researcher
and a reporter in developing countries,
but I do it with an altered
ethic of seeing.
I ask myself whether
my pictures are pandering,
whether they contribute to stereotypes,
whether the images match the message,
am I complacent or am I complicit?

Thank you.

(Applause)
