Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don't have to stand up,
but ...
we can see you really clearly —

(Laughter)

So you have to dance with us.
And we have this, like,
choreographed dance thing
that we're about to do —

Betta Lemme: Really easy.

SHW: And we're going to flick
our wrists like this,
and you're going to do it with us.
And you can also stand up.

(Music)

(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

It came, it came,
it went, it went

It conquered quick

I was there and then I quit

Awoo!

I know I did not raise a wrist

I know I did not capture it

It came, it came,
it went, it went

It conquered quick

I was there and then I quit

Awoo!

BL: (Speaks) There you go!

(Music)

SHW: We have another one coming up.
It's a little finger-pointing dance.

(Music)

The people sitting down,
I want to see your fingers pointing.
Yeah!

(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

(Both sing) I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went

It conquered quick

I was there and then I quit

Aaaa ...

(Applause)

Awoo!

(Music)

(Clapping to the beat)

(Music)

Aaaa ...

SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.

(Both sing) I know
I did not raise a wrist

I know I did not capture it

It came, it came,
it went, it went

It conquered quick

I was there and then I quit

I know I did not raise a wrist

I know I did not capture it

It came, it came,
it went, it went

It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit

(Music)

Tucker Halpern: You guys are way more fun
than I thought you'd be.

(Laughter)

(Music)

Awoo!

(Applause)

SHW: Thank you so much.

(Applause)
