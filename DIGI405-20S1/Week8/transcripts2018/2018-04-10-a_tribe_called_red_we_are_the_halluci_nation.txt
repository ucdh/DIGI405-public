(Music)

We are the tribe that they cannot see

We live on an industrial reservation

We are the Halluci Nation

We have been called the Indians

We have been called Native American

We have been called hostile

We have been called pagan

We have been called militant

We have been called many names

We are the Halluci Nation

We are the human beings

The callers of names cannot see us
but we can see them

We are the Halluci Nation

Our DNA is of earth and sky

Our DNA is of past and future

We are the Halluci Nation

We are the evolution,
the continuation

The Halluci Nation

(Music)

The virus took on many shapes

The bear, the elk, the antelope,
the elephant, the deer

The mineral, the iron, the copper,
the coltan, the rubber

The coffee, the cotton, the sugar

The people

The germ traveled faster than the bullet

They harvest the mountainside,
protect the crops, herd the cattle

The people

The women and children
were separated from the men

They divided us according to the regional
filters of their minds

The violence of arrogance
crawls into the air,
nestles into the geospatial cortex

We are not a conquered people

The compound was on fire

The missionaries never hid
their perspective

Prospectors of land
would rather see us disappear

Recyclable prayers

The people

This is my body which is given for you

The people

This is my blood

We are not a conquered people

(Electronic music and chanting)

I was wakened by my elder brother

The compound was on fire

Awakened by my elder brother

The compound was on fire

(Music)

The compound was on fire

The compound was on fire

The Halluci Nation

The human beings

The people

See the spiritual in the natural

Through sense and feeling

Everything is related

All the things of earth

And in the sky have spirit

Everything is sacred

Confronted by the ALie Nation

The subjects and the citizens

See the material religions

Through trauma and numb

Nothing is related

All the things of the earth and in the sky
have energy to be exploited

Even themselves, mining their spirits
into souls sold

Into nothing is sacred

Not even their self

The ALie Nation

Alienation

Ancestors

Live in the DNA

In genetic memory

The evolution of descendants

Human being is our natural identity

Natural identity
is where the power of being

Waits for human recognition

To understand

Not to just know

But to understand sacred

Without religion we evolve

Back into our ancestors

With religion we disappear

Into religious heaven and hell

(Electronic music and chanting)

Human beings

We are human, we are of the earth

(Electronic music and chanting)

Human beings

We are human

We are of the earth

Our bone, flesh, blood,
metals, minerals, liquids, of earth

We are earth

We are being

We are of the sky

The sun, moon, stars

A reality of how ancestors live

We are the children of earth and sky

We are the Halluci Nation
