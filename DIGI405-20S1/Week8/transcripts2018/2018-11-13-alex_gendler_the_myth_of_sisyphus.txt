Whether it’s being chained to a burning 
wheel, turned into a spider,
or having an eagle eat one’s liver,
Greek mythology is filled 
with stories of the gods
inflicting gruesome horrors 
on mortals who angered them.
Yet one of their most famous 
punishments is not remembered
for its outrageous cruelty, 
but for its disturbing familiarity.

Sisyphus was the first king of Ephyra, 
now known as Corinth.
Although a clever ruler who made his city 
prosperous, he was also a devious tyrant
who seduced his niece and 
killed visitors to show off his power.
This violation of the sacred hospitality 
tradition greatly angered the gods.
But Sisyphus may still have 
avoided punishment
if it hadn’t been for his 
reckless confidence.

The trouble began when Zeus 
kidnapped the nymph Aegina,
carrying her away in the form 
of a massive eagle.
Aegina’s father, the river god Asopus, 
pursued their trail to Ephyra,
where he encountered Sisyphus.
In exchange for the god making
a spring inside the city,
the king told Asopus which way 
Zeus had taken the girl.
When Zeus found out, he was so furious
that he ordered Thanatos, or Death,
to chain Sisyphus in the underworld 
so he couldn’t cause any more problems.

But Sisyphus lived up to 
his crafty reputation.
As he was about to be imprisoned,
the king asked Thanatos to show him 
how the chains worked
– and quickly bound him instead, 
before escaping back among the living.
With Thanatos trapped, no one could die, 
and the world was thrown into chaos.
Things only returned to normal 
when the god of war Ares,
upset that battles were no longer fun, 
freed Thanatos from his chains.

Sisyphus knew his reckoning was at hand.
But he had another trick up his sleeve.
Before dying, he asked his wife Merope
to throw his body in the public square,
from where it eventually washed up on 
the shores of the river Styx.
Now back among the dead, 
Sisyphus approached Persephone,
queen of the Underworld, and complained
that his wife had disrespected him 
by not giving him a proper burial.
Persephone granted him permission to go
back to the land of living
and punish Merope, on the condition that 
he would return when he was done.
Of course, Sisyphus refused 
to keep his promise,
now having twice escaped death
by tricking the gods.

There wouldn’t be a third time,
as the messenger Hermes dragged
Sisyphus back to Hades.
The king had thought he was 
more clever than the gods,
but Zeus would have the last laugh.
Sisyphus’s punishment was 
a straightforward task
– rolling a massive boulder up a hill.
But just as he approached the top, the 
rock would roll all the way back down,
forcing him to start over
…and over, and over, for all eternity.

Historians have suggested that the tale 
of Sisyphus may stem from ancient myths
about the rising and setting sun, 
or other natural cycles.
But the vivid image of someone condemned 
to endlessly repeat a futile task
has resonated as an allegory 
about the human condition.
In his classic essay
The Myth of Sisyphus,
existentialist philosopher Albert Camus 
compared the punishment
to humanity’s futile search 
for meaning and truth
in a meaningless and 
indifferent universe.
Instead of despairing, Camus imagined 
Sisyphus defiantly meeting his fate
as he walks down the hill to begin 
rolling the rock again.
And even if the daily 
struggles of our lives
sometimes seem equally 
repetitive and absurd,
we still give them significance and value 
by embracing them as our own.
