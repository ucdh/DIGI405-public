TC Milan: How you doing tonight?
New York!

(Music)

Here we go.

(Singing) I don't need another lover

I got my friends

No, I don't need another mother —

bet that you can guess

Oh baby, can you talk right

act tight, don't fight

follow my rules?

Oh baby, can you stay sweet

upbeat

fill me with all your cool?

Are you man enough for me?

Nicki B: Are you man enough for me?

TM: Are you man enough to be?

Oooh

Keep it hot, assess my pleasure

Just keep it real

Alright, this next one's "Bohanna."

(Singing) All the way back
to where
we began

Out of the mess
they put
us in

Le Chev: Bang, bang, off the chain

(Singing) Oooh

LC: Bang, bang, through the pain

(Singing) Oh

LC: Bang, bang, off the chain

(Singing) Oooh

One, two, three, let's go!

(Singing) Bohanna

Music for dancing

Bohanna

Flowers where you go

Bohanna

Music for dancing

We clap, clap our hands for you

NB: Little bit of rain
makes the window shine —

NB: Dance with Bohanna,
drink that red, red wine

(Music changes)

TM: This is the last song.

(Cheers)

Thank you!

(Music)

(Singing) I was broken down

torn up and turned around

I got lost in the darkest cloud

I felt there was no way out

No

I almost lost control

I forgot what I was living for

But I still got my energy

and the music gives me all I need

We dance, we make the club our own

We chant at night to free our souls

It's that time of the night
when the music is right

Hey, DJ, won't you play
my song one more time?

We dance

Oooh

We dance, we make the club our home

We chant at night to free our souls

You've been kicked around

beat up and beat down

And when you make a joyful sound —
oh ...

Someone's there to shut it down

So much to overcome

That struggle

it's never, never done

Still got that energy

And the music gives you all you need

We dance, we make the club our own

We chant at night to free our souls

It's that time of the night
when the music is right

Hey, DJ, won't you play
my song one more time?

We dance

(Music)

We dance, we make the club our own

We chant at night to free our souls

We dance, we make the club our home —

TM: Can you guys clap with us?

(Singing) We chant
at night to free our souls

TM: Alright, New York.

It's that time.

It's that TED Talks time.

We're sitting down

but we're grooving out, right?

(Singing) We dance

TM: You know we dance

After this, we're going to go dance,
all of us, altogether
at Chever's house.

(Singing) We dance

(Clapping)

Alright, now we're just going
to do a simple wave, right?
Easy, from our seats.

(Singing) We dance

NB: Uh huh.

TM: There we go.

(Singing) We dance

TM: One, two, one, two, three —

(Singing) We dance,
we make the club our home

We chant at night to free our souls

It's that time of the night
when the music is right

Hey, DJ, won't you play
my song one more time?

We dance

Oooh.

We dance, we make the club our own

We chant at night to free our souls

We dance

(Music ends)

Thank you.

(Applause and cheers)
