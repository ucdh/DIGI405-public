From space, our planet appears
to be more ocean than Earth.
But despite the water covering 71%
of the planet’s surface,
more than half the world’s population
endures extreme water scarcity
for at least one month a year.
And current estimates predict
that by 2040,
up to 20 more countries could be 
experiencing water shortages.
Taken together, these bleak statistics
raise a startling question:
are we running out of clean water?

Well yes, and no.
At a planetary scale, Earth can’t run out 
of freshwater thanks to the water cycle,
a system that continuously produces 
and recycles water,
morphing it from vapour, to liquid, 
to ice as it circulates around the globe.
So this isn’t really a question of 
how much water there is,
but of how much of it 
is accessible to us.
97% of earth’s liquid is saltwater,
too loaded with minerals for humans
to drink or use in agriculture.
Of the remaining 3% of potentially 
usable freshwater,
more than two-thirds is frozen
in ice caps and glaciers.
That leaves less than 1% available 
for sustaining all life on Earth,
spread across our planet
in rivers, lakes,
underground aquifers, ground ice
and permafrost.
It’s these sources of water that are being
rapidly depleted by humans,
but slowly replenished 
by rain and snowfall.

And this limited supply isn’t distributed
evenly around the globe.
Diverse climates and geography
provide some regions
with more rainfall and natural water sources,
while other areas have geographic features
that make transporting water 
much more difficult.
And supplying the infrastructure 
and energy it would take
to move water across these 
regions is extremely expensive.

In many of these water-poor areas, as well
as some with greater access to water,
humanity is guzzling up the local water
supply faster than it can be replenished.
And when more quickly renewed 
sources can’t meet the demand,
we start pumping it out of our 
finite underground reserves.
Of Earth’s 37 major underground reservoirs,
21 are on track to be irreversibly emptied.
So while it’s true that our planet 
isn’t actually losing water,
we are depleting the water sources
we rely on at an unsustainable pace.

This might seem surprising –
after all, on average, people only drink 
about two liters of water a day.
But water plays a hidden role in our daily
lives, and in that same 24 hours,
most people will actually consume
an estimated 3000 liters of water.
In fact, household water – which we use
to drink, cook, and clean –
accounts for only 3.6% of humanity’s
water consumption.
Another 4.4% goes to the wide 
range of factories
which make the products we buy each day.
But the remaining 92% of our water
consumption is all spent on a single industry:
agriculture.

Our farms drain the equivalent of
3.3 billion
Olympic-sized swimming pools every year,
all of it swallowed up by 
crops and livestock
to feed Earth’s growing population.
Agriculture currently covers 37% 
of Earth’s land area,
posing the biggest threat to our 
regional water supplies.
And yet, it’s also a necessity.
So how do we limit agriculture’s thirst
while still feeding those who rely on it?

Farmers are already finding ingenious
ways to reduce their impact,
like using special irrigation techniques 
to grow “more crop per drop”,
and breeding new crops 
that are less thirsty.
Other industries are following suit,
adopting production processes 
that reuse and recycle water.
On a personal level, reducing food waste 
is the first step to reducing water use,
since one-third of the food that leaves 
farms is currently wasted or thrown away.
You might also want to consider 
eating less water-intensive foods
like shelled nuts and red meat.
Adopting a vegetarian lifestyle 
could reduce
up to one third of your water footprint.
Our planet may never run out of water, 

but it doesn’t have to for 
individuals to go thirsty.
Solving this local problem 
requires a global solution,
and small day-to-day decisions can 
affect reservoirs around the world.
