Good afternoon.
I'd like to talk to you about laughter
and the importance of laughter as a skill.
And to do so, I'm going
to start by discussing
some American foreign policy
because that's always -
(Laughter)
absolutely hilarious.
(Laughter)
Back in 1995, towards the end
of the war in the former Yugoslavia,
they'd been a very ill-tempered speech
given by Boris Yeltsin at the UN
about the involvement
of the Russian Federation in NATO,
and then he had
a meeting with Bill Clinton,
in which some of these
same issues were coming up,
and it was considered to be,
likely to be a bit of a row.
So, what actually happened
when these two men came out?
They gave a press conference
about their summit.
And can we learn anything
about laughter if we watch this?
(Video) Host: Good afternoon. 
Bill Clinton: Mr. President.
(On stage) Sophie Scott:
Watch Bill Clinton.
(Video) Boris Yeltsin: (In Russian)
Ladies and gentlemen,
SS: Yeltsin -
(Video) BY: (In Russian) dear journalists,
SS: ... doesn't sound very happy.
(Video) BY: (In Russian) First of all,
I have to say that
I was coming to this meeting
at the invitation of the President
of the United States, Bill Clinton,
not with the same optimism
as I am feeling right now.
Interpreter: I want to say, first of all,
that when I came here to the United States
for this visit at the invitation
of the President of the United States,
Bill Clinton,
I did not, at that time,
have the degree of optimism
with which I now am departing.
BY: And this is all because of you -
SS: (Laughter)
(Video) BY: because even
in all today's newspapers,
based on my yesterday's statement
at the United Nations, you predicted
that our meeting today would be a failure.
Interpreter: And this is all due to you,
because coming from my statement
yesterday in the United Nations,
and if you looked at the press reports,
one could see that what you were writing
was that today's meeting
with President Bill Clinton
was going to be a disaster.
(Laughter)
SS: A big laugh.
(Video) BY: And now, for the first time,
I'm telling you that you have failed.
Interpreter: But now, for the first time,
I can tell you that you're a disaster.
(Laughter)
SS: Enormous laugh.
(Laughter)
Helpless with the laughter.
(Laughter)
(Video) BC: Be sure you get
the right attribution there.
(Laughter)
SS: Boris Yeltsin now starts laughing.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
No one's able to get
anything done for a while now.
That tends to happen with laughter.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
These guys.
(Laughter)
So what is laughter?
Clearly, that was quite an enjoyable thing
in a rather surprising setting.
Laughter, actually,
is a very interesting behaviour.
We tend to associate it
with comedy and humour,
but laughter is primarily
a social behaviour.
You're 30 times more likely
to laugh with somebody else
than if you're on your own.
And frequently, this means
your laughter happens
when you're in conversation,
because that tends to be what happens
when you're with other people.
And very often, that laughter
is simply contagious laughter.
You laugh just because other
people are laughing.
You just catch a laugh.
You're much more likely to catch
a laugh from someone you know
than someone you don't know,
and in conversations.
We're still currently not laughing
at jokes and humour
with punchlines necessarily.
We're laughing to show agreement.
We're laughing to show understanding.
We're laughing to show
that we agree and we see
where somebody's coming from.
We share that experience.
We laugh much more with people we know
and people we feel comfortable around.
We laugh - we don't laugh rather
if we're feeling exposed
or we're feeling awkward.
When we're comfortable, when we can relax,
when we're with people familiar to us,
people we like, people
with whom we share affection,
we laugh even more.
When we're children, we learn to laugh,
and we learn to laugh primarily in play.
And play is a very important behaviour,
and we frequently use laughter
to indicate that we are playing.
The same behaviour
could simply be pure aggression
(Laughter)
where not for the marking of it as play.
And this is done with laughter primarily.
We will use laughter,
not just to show that we're part
of the same group of somebody -
we like them, we understand them,
we agree with them.
We will also use laughter
to sort of show we understand
that they may be trying to make us laugh;
we pick up on their intentions.
And we'll also use laughter
to try and control situations.
We'll use laughter to try
and make ourselves feel better.
And it only works if everybody joins in.
If one person's going, "Hahahahaha,"
and no one else is laughing,
that tends not to make
anybody feel better at all.
(Laughter)
If everybody joins in,
laughter is actually an effective way
of improving the positive mood
of a group of people.
And people can use laughter
because of this link,
with sort of de-escalation from stress.
People will use laughter
to show that they're OK.
"I'm angry that you've poured
yellow paint all over me.
I'm delighted. This is exactly
how I hoped my day would go."
(Laughter)
Charles Darwin, very interestingly,
got a lot of stuff right
about the sort of how we started
to look at emotions
in the study of psychology
over the next 150 years after his writing.
He wrote about things
like anger and disgust and fear,
but he also wrote a lot about laughter,
and we largely ignored that.
There's actually very, very little
scientific research into laughter.
But Charles Darwin thought
that laughter was really important,
and he thought that at its heart,
it was an expression of joy;
it's a joyful emotion.
And it's joy in play, it's joy in company,
it's joy in the company of those we love.
I think it's really important
to think about that
when we think about laughter.
We also think about
how that could go wrong.
Because we learn to laugh.
Babies will laugh when they're tickled
or somebody plays peek-a-boo with them.
But it's a behaviour we can encourage.
We learn what laughter means.
We learn to understand laughter.
And we can see that going wrong.
So this is a study that I did
with my colleague
Essi Viding at UCL last year,
where we were studying teenage boys
who are at risk of psychopathy.
They have conduct disorders,
and they have high inputs
called callous-unemotional traits.
So they're not behaving well,
and they don't care if they hurt people.
And what we find,
when they listen to laughter
compared to control teenage boys,
who are normally developing,
is that behaviourally,
they don't find laughter contagious.
They don't join in
when somebody else laughs,
and they don't want to join in
when somebody else laughs.
If we look at their brain where normally,
when people hear laughter,
you can see this priming response,
you can see people
getting ready to join in,
they show a significantly reduced effect.
Now, we don't know, in this context,
if we're seeing this
because those boys have always
had a problem learning to laugh
because of these conduct disorders
and these callous-unemotional
traits that they have,
has that affected
how they engage with laughter,
or have they never had
the opportunity to learn to laugh?
Had they not been laughed with?
Have they not been played with?
Of course, we need a lot more
research to look into this.
There's an even more extreme
condition called "gelotophobia,"
where people not only don't want
to join in when they hear laughter,
they are actively frightened
and respond aggressively to laughter.
They're the kind of person
who's walking down the streets,
hears laughter,
think they're being laughed at
and they punch that person.
And you never find gelotophobia
outside of the most profound
psychological disturbances.
So in fact, we can see laughter
and the reaction to laughter
spanning a huge different quality
and properties of human experience,
and kind of lives that we can live.

It can be an incredibly
positive social tool,
or it can be something that you fear
depending on your experiences.
So, thinking about that,
can we go back to that bit of film
and think about why on earth
Bill Clinton was laughing.
Well, from the start,
he's watching Boris Yeltsin like a hawk.
All his attention is on him.
And he looks like - actually,
he's waiting for a reason to laugh.
And then he gets his reason,
because Boris Yeltsin says his name,
Bill Clinton, and he laughs then.
It's pure laugh of recognition:
"Yes, ha ha ha, my name is Bill Clinton."
(Laughter)
Don't knock it, if it gets
a laugh, it gets a laugh.
So that's his reason. He's got going.
And then Boris Yeltsin says the line
about that you thought
it would be a disaster
but you're the disaster.
Actually, that's a mistranslation;
he used the word "failure,"
and it's mistranslated
by the Russian-American interpreter.
People have said that Bill Clinton
is laughing at this mistranslation.
I don't know if that's giving,
but possibly he is.
Most people probably
didn't pick up on that.
It's likely that he's now
just using that as a reason
both to escalate the laughter
and also to reframe
what is quite an insulting comment
by Boris Yeltsin as a joke.
He's de-escalating the situation
and he's re-presenting it to us
as: This guy is hilarious.
(Laughter)
It completely changes our perception
and importantly Boris Yeltsin's
perception of what's going on.
Boris Yeltsin, "So yeah,
I am killing it here."
(Laughter)
"This is very funny."

(Laughter)
And he carries on; he now gets
a smile out of Yeltsin who cracks,
and then he gets his laugh.
Boris Yeltsin starts to laugh,
and he is laughing primarily here
through pure contagion.
For a while, they're both
incapacitated by the laughter,
and that happens with laughter;
it will stop you doing anything else
for a short amount of time.
And then they go back.
OK, they're doing OK.
So why - why was Bill Clinton laughing?
Well, we've got the recognition,
and then we've got the the kind
of comment, the joke of reframing,
and that's actually really important.
He is de-escalating
and reframes the whole thing.
The atmosphere was tense,
and he turns that
into a positive situation.
So he's de-escalating the stress,
and he's just reframing everything
as "This is great fun we're having,
and this is just hilarious.
This guy's so funny."
He's also showing that he is quite
comfortable in that situation.
We don't laugh when we feel
exposed or awkward.
So Clinton's showing he's confident:
"This is fine. You guys
might have been worried about this.
I know we're golden.
This guy's hilarious."
And that really matters to us.
We learn, when we are very, very young,
to use our parents laughter
as a way of working out
whether a situation is serious or not.
Children of 12 months old
will use their parents laughter,
or their absence of laughter,
to work out if an unfamiliar situation
is something they should worry about.
We continue doing that, so it matters
that Bill Clinton is doing this.
And he's also showing
that he's affiliated with Yeltsin.
He's showing that he feels
affection towards him.
And Yeltsin does the same thing.
We don't catch laughs
off people we don't like.
We don't catch laughs
off people we don't know.
So actually, they're marking
their bond there.
And the final point
that I think is really intriguing
is Bill Clinton, at no stage,
makes it look like
he's laughing at Boris Yeltsin.
He goes to great pains to include him.
He's not going, "This guy is an idiot.
Let's laugh at him."
It would mean something
very, very different if he did.
In fact, I think generally,
in American foreign policy,
anybody's foreign policy,
don't laugh in the face
of a premier state from another country.
It's probably eight-o'clock
day-one of a rule.
He includes him in that laughter.
And this is a really important
factor about laughter.
Because laughter is about making
and maintaining social bonds,
people are very cautious about working out
where they are in relation to that.
And this does mean
you can't just take a difficult situation
and throw a squirt of laughter at it;
you've got to make sure
people feel included in that laughter.
They're not feeling excluded
or offended by that laughter.
And this leads us back to perhaps
a more important aspect of laughter.
It's an important social skill
that we learn to do.
We learn about the social use of laughter
throughout our entire early adult life,
and it's probably one of the more
important social skills that we acquire.
And we should probably
take this a lot more seriously.
We should think about the things
that can affect our laughter.
We can think about the things
that we could do to encourage
our understanding of our laughter.
And perhaps the takeaway message
is take laughter seriously.
Think about your laughter.
Don't undervalue
or trivialise your laughter.
It matters. It matters a lot.
It can sound like friendship.
It can sometimes sound a lot like love.
Thank you.
(Applause)
