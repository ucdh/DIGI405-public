The family of giants you work for
is throwing a fancy dinner party,
and they all want to look their best.
But there’s a problem –
the elder giant’s favorite 
shirt is wrinkled!
To fix it, you’ll need to power up…
the Giant Iron.

The iron needs two giant 
batteries to work.
You just had 4 working ones
and 4 dead ones in separate piles,
but it looks like the baby giant 
mixed them all up.
You need to get the iron working 
and press the giant shirt, fast –
or you’ll end up being the 
main course tonight!

How can you test the batteries
so that you’re guaranteed to get 
a working pair in 7 tries or less?

You could, of course, take 
all eight batteries
and begin testing the 28 
possible combinations.
You might get lucky within 
the first few tries.
But if you don’t, moving the giant 
batteries that many times
will take way too long.
You can’t rely on luck –
you need to assume the worst 
possibility and plan accordingly.

However, you don’t actually need 
to test every possible combination.
Remember – there are four 
good batteries in total,
meaning that any pile of six you choose
will have at least two 
good batteries in it.
That doesn’t help you right away,
since testing all six batteries could 
still take as many as 15 tries.
But it does give you 
a clue to the solution –
dividing the batteries into smaller 
subsets narrows down the possible results.

So instead of six batteries,
let’s take any three.
This group has a total of three 
possible combinations.
Since both batteries have to be 
working for the iron to power up,
a single failure can’t tell you whether 
both batteries are dead, or just one.
But if all three combinations fail,
then you’ll know this group has either 
one good battery, or none at all.
Now you can set those three aside
and repeat the process for 
another three batteries.
You might get a match, but if every 
combination fails again,
you’ll know this set can have 
no more than one good battery.
That would leave only two 
batteries untried.
Since there are four good 
batteries in total
and you’ve only accounted for two so far,
both of these remaining ones must be good.

Dividing the batteries into 
sets of 3, 3, and 2
is guaranteed to get a working result 
in 7 tries or less,
no matter what order 
you test the piles in.

With no time to spare, 
the iron comes to life,
and you manage to get the shirt 
flawlessly ironed.
The pleased elder and his family show up 
to the party dressed to the nines
… well, almost.
