The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang
nearly fourteen billion
years ago,
and has been expanding 
ever since.
But what is it expanding into?
That's a complicated question.
Here's why:
Einstein's equations of
general relativity
describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected
fabric for the universe.
This means that what we know of
as space and time
exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it.
Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out
into more space.
But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into,
what does expanding 
even mean?
In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations
gave us a definitive answer.
His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies
recede, or move away,
from the Earth.
Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes.
How can we interpret this?
Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven.
The batter rises by the same
amount in between each
and every raisin.
If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies,
and batter as the space
between them,
we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion
of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other,
and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger
distance than the nearby ones
in the same amount of time.
Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic
tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion.
It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out,
and space stretches.
So there's our answer.
The universe is expanding 
unto itself.
That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models
to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime.
These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle
kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang.
The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe,
as a sparse gas —but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be?
The inflationary model 
describes a brief era
of incredibly rapid expansion
that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe,
to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies.
If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents
one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation.
We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality,
save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion
may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state.
In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random
chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes.
Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them
—would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics.
Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse,
in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible
for us to encounter a neighbor universe.
The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces
may unify into one super-force.
Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification,
in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons.
In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe.
Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description,
and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes.
Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane,
floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace.
Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace,
and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity.
Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse,
but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other.
An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background
—a soup of radiation throughout our universe, 
that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era.
So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo.
Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description,
or be replaced by something else.
As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models.
While these models are inspired and 
guided by many scientific experiments,
there are very few objective experiments 
to directly test them, yet.
Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along,
scientists will likely be left to argue about 
the elegance of their competing models…
and continue to dream about what, 
if anything, lies beyond our universe.
