The contents of this metal cylinder could
either revolutionize technology
or be completely useless—
it all depends on whether we can harness
the strange physics of matter
at very, very small scales.
To have even a chance of doing so,
we have to control the environment 
precisely:
the thick tabletop and legs guard against
vibrations from footsteps,
nearby elevators, and opening
or closing doors.
The cylinder is a vacuum chamber,
devoid of all the gases in air.
Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller,
extremely cold compartment, 
reachable by tiny laser beams.
Inside are ultra-sensitive particles
that make up a quantum computer.

So what makes these particles 
worth the effort?
In theory, quantum computers could 
outstrip the computational limits
of classical computers.
Classical computers process 
data in the form of bits.
Each bit can switch between two states 
labeled zero and one.
A quantum computer uses something 
called a qubit,
which can switch between zero, one, 
and what’s called a superposition.
While the qubit is in its superposition,
it has a lot more information 
than one or zero.
You can think of these positions as 
points on a sphere:
the north and south poles of the sphere 
represent one and zero.
A bit can only switch between 
these two poles,
but when a qubit is in its superposition,
it can be at any point on the sphere.
We can’t locate it exactly—
the moment we read it, the qubit resolves 
into a zero or a one.
But even though we can’t observe the 
qubit in its superposition,
we can manipulate it to perform 
particular operations while in this state.

So as a problem grows more complicated,
a classical computer needs correspondingly
more bits to solve it,
while a quantum computer will 
theoretically be able to handle
more and more complicated problems
without requiring as many more qubits as a
classical computer would need bits.

The unique properties of quantum computers
result from the behavior of atomic 
and subatomic particles.
These particles have quantum states,
which correspond to the 
state of the qubit.
Quantum states are incredibly fragile,
easily destroyed by temperature 
and pressure fluctuations,
stray electromagnetic fields,
and collisions with nearby particles.
That’s why quantum computers need 
such an elaborate set up.
It’s also why, for now,
the power of quantum computers 
remains largely theoretical.
So far, we can only control a few qubits 
in the same place at the same time.

There are two key components involved
in managing these fickle quantum 
states effectively:
the types of particles a quantum 
computer uses,
and how it manipulates those particles.
For now, there are two leading approaches:
trapped ions and superconducting qubits.

A trapped ion quantum computer uses 
ions as its particles
and manipulates them with lasers.
The ions are housed in a trap made 
of electrical fields.
Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what 
operation to make
by causing the qubit state 
to rotate on the sphere.
To use a simplified example,
the lasers could input the question:
what are the prime factors of 15?
In response, the ions may release photons—
the state of the qubit determines whether
the ion emits photons
and how many photons it emits.
An imaging system collects these photons
and processes them to reveal the answer:
3 and 5.

Superconducting qubit quantum computers
do the same thing in a different way:
using a chip with electrical circuits 
instead of an ion trap.
The states of each electrical circuit 
translate to the state of the qubit.
They can be manipulated with electrical
inputs in the form of microwaves.
So: the qubits come from either ions 
or electrical circuits,
acted on by either lasers or microwaves.
Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages.
Ions can be manipulated very precisely,
and they last a long time,
but as more ions are added to a trap,
it becomes increasingly difficult to 
control each with precision.
We can’t currently contain enough ions 
in a trap to make advanced computations,
but one possible solution might be to 
connect many smaller traps
that communicate with each 
other via photons
rather than trying to create one big trap.
Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make
operations much faster than trapped ions,
and it’s easier to scale up the number 
of circuits in a computer
than the number of ions.
But the circuits are also more fragile,
and have a shorter overall lifespan.

And as quantum computers advance,
they will still be subject to the 
environmental constraints
needed to preserve quantum states.
But in spite of all these obstacles,
we’ve already succeeded at making 
computations
in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.
