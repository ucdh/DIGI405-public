(Music)

Sun shining up above
down here it's 10 below

I'm moving on to a place now
where the streets are paved with gold

There'll be two trains running —
running side by side

Some trains are going out

Two trains running —
running side by side

I'm going to catch that fast express train
to my reward in the sky

Many rooms in my father's house now —
Oh Lord there's one for you and me

Many rooms in my father's house now —
Oh there's one for you and me

No blues and no trouble
Oh my Lord sweet Jesus victory

There's one glory from the moon —
Lord another, oh another from the sun

Oh one glory from the moon
and another from the sun

Behind I'll leave this earthly body
when my Lord king Jesus comes

Thank you very much.

(Applause)
