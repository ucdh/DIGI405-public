In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons.
There’s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people,
but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium.
The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis;
the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis.
Today, tuberculosis, or TB,
is still one of the world’s biggest 
infectious killers,
causing more deaths than malaria or 
even HIV and AIDS.
But what exactly is this disease, and how 
has this pathogen persisted for so long?

Typically, TB bacteria called 
mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne.
They travel into our airways and 
infect our lungs.
Here, immune cells called macrophages 
rush to the infection site,
attempting to absorb and break down 
the bacterial invaders.
In many cases, this response is enough 
to remove the bacteria.
But in individuals with other 
medical conditions–
ranging from malnutrition and HIV to 
diabetes and pregnancy
–the immune response may not be 
strong enough to destroy the intruder.
If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will 
reproduce inside those macrophages,
and form colonies in the 
surrounding lung tissue.
As they infect more cells,
the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes
that destroy the infected tissue,
triggering chest pain, and causing 
patients to cough up blood.
The damage to the lungs leads to 
oxygen deprivation.
This begins a flood of hormonal changes–
including a decrease in appetite and 
iron production.
From here, microbes can spread to the 
skeletal system,
causing back pain and difficulty moving;
to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain;
and to the brain, causing headaches 
and even impaired consciousness.

These symptoms produce the 
classic image of TB:
weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, 
and ashen skin.
This ghostly appearance earned TB 
the title of the ‘White Plague’
in Victorian-era England.
During this period, tuberculosis was 
considered a ‘romantic disease,'
because it tended to affect poverty-
stricken artists and poets–
those with weaker immune systems.
TB’s outward symptoms even helped 
fuel the popular myth of vampirism.

In spite of– or perhaps because of 
these less than scientific concerns,
this period also marked the first strides 
toward curing TB.
In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch
identified the disease’s 
bacterial origins.
13 years later, physicist Wilhelm 
Roentgen  discovered the X-ray,
enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body.
These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines–
first for smallpox, and again in 1921,
when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB.
These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics–
currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments.
But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication:
about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms.
In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant,
only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense.
This makes TB much harder to diagnose.
And even when properly identified,
traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months,
requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects.
This discourages people from finishing 
the full course,
and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs.

Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries,
most of which face other health crises
that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases.
Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries,
and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need.
Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics,
faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines.
Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours,
as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%.
Hopefully, with advancements like these,
we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.
