"New drug may cure cancer."
"Aspirin may reduce risk of 
heart attacks."
"Eating breakfast can help 
you lose weight."

Health headlines like these 
flood the news,
often contradicting each other.
So how can you figure out what’s a
genuine health concern
or a truly promising remedy,
and what’s less conclusive?

In medicine,
there’s often a disconnect between 
news headlines
and the scientific research they cover.
That’s because a headline is designed 
to catch attention—
it’s most effective when 
it makes a big claim.
By contrast,
many scientific studies produce 
meaningful results
when they focus on a narrow, 
specific question.

The best way to bridge this gap
is to look at the original research 
behind a headline.
We’ve come up with a simplified 
research scenario
for each of these three headlines
to test your skills.
Keep watching for the explanation 
of the first study;
then pause at the headline 
to figure out the flaw.
Assume all the information you need
to spot the flaw is included.

Let’s start with this hypothetical 
scenario:
a study using mice to test 
a new cancer drug.
The study includes two groups of mice,
one treated with the drug, 
the other with a placebo.
At the end of the trial,
the mice that receive the drug are cured,
while those that received 
the placebo are not.

Can you spot the problem 
with this headline:
"Study shows new drug 
could cure cancer"

Since the subjects of the study were mice,
we can’t draw conclusions about 
human disease based on this research.
In real life, early research on new drugs
and therapies is not conducted on humans.
If the early results are promising,
clinical trials follow to determine 
if they hold up in humans.

Now that you’ve warmed up,
let’s try a trickier example:
a study about the impact of aspirin 
on heart attack risk.
The study randomly divides a pool 
of men into two groups.
The members of one group 
take aspirin daily,
while the others take a daily placebo.
By the end of the trial,
the control group suffered significantly 
more heart attacks
than the group that took aspirin.

Based on this situation, what’s wrong 
with the headline:
"Aspirin may reduce risk of heart attacks"

In this case, the study shows evidence 
that aspirin reduces heart attacks in men,
because all the participants were men.
But the conclusion “aspirin reduces risk 
of heart attacks” is too broad;
we can’t assume that results found in
men would also apply to women.
Studies often limit participants based on
geographic location, age, gender,
or many other factors.
Before these findings can be generalized,
similar studies need to be run 
on other groups.
If a headline makes a general claim,
it should draw its evidence from a diverse
body of research, not one study.

Can you take your skills from the first
two questions to the next level?
Try this example about the impact 
of eating breakfast on weight loss.
Researchers recruit a group of people 
who had always skipped breakfast
and ask them to start 
eating breakfast everyday.
The participants include men and women 
of a range of ages and backgrounds.
Over a year-long period,
participants lose an average 
of five pounds.

So what’s wrong with the headline:
"Eating breakfast can help 
you lose weight"

The people in the study started eating 
breakfast and lost weight—
but we don’t know that they lost weight
because they started eating breakfast;
perhaps having their weight tracked
inspired them to change their eating 
habits in other ways.
To rule out the possibility that 
some other factor caused weight loss,
we would need to compare 
these participants
to a group who didn’t eat breakfast 
before the study
and continued to skip it during the study.
A headline certainly shouldn’t claim the 
results of this research
are generally applicable.
And if the study itself made such 
a claim without a comparison group,
then you should question its credibility.

Now that you’ve battle-tested your skills
on these hypothetical studies 
and headlines,
you can test them on real-world news.
Even when full papers aren’t available 
without a fee,
you can often find summaries of 
experimental design and results
in freely available abstracts,
or even within the text 
of a news article.
Individual studies have results
that don’t necessarily correspond 
to a grabby headline.
Big conclusions for human health issues
require lots of evidence accumulated 
over time.
But in the meantime,
we can keep on top of the science, 
by reading past the headlines.
