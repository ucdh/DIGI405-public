You spend weeks studying 
for an important test.
On the big day, you wait nervously
as your teacher hands it out.
You’re working your way through, 
when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’
You know you’ve seen it before, 
but your mind goes blank.
What just happened?

The answer lies in 
the complex relationship
between stress and memory.
There are many types 
and degrees of stress
and different kinds of memory,
but we’re going to focus on 
how short-term stress
impacts your memory for facts.

To start, it helps to understand 
how this kind of memory works.
Facts you read, hear, or study
become memories through
a process with three main steps.
First comes acquisition:
the moment you encounter
a new piece of information.
Each sensory experience activates 
a unique set of brain areas.

In order to become lasting memories,
these sensory experiences
have to be consolidated 
by the hippocampus,
influenced by the amygdala,
which emphasizes experiences 
associated with strong emotions.
The hippocampus then encodes memories,
probably by strengthening 
the synaptic connections
stimulated during 
the original sensory experience.

Once a memory has been encoded,
it can be remembered, 
or retrieved, later.
Memories are stored all over the brain,
and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex 
that signals for their retrieval.

So how does stress 
affect each of these stages?
In the first two stages,
moderate stress can actually 
help experiences enter your memory.
Your brain responds to stressful stimuli
by releasing hormones 
known as corticosteroids,
which activate a process 
of threat-detection
and threat-response in the amygdala.
The amygdala prompts your hippocampus
to consolidate the stress-inducing 
experience into a memory.
Meanwhile, the flood 
of corticosteroids from stress
stimulates your hippocampus,
also prompting memory consolidation.

But even though some stress 
can be helpful,
extreme and chronic stress 
can have the opposite effect.
Researchers have tested this by injecting
rats directly with stress hormones.
As they gradually increased 
the dose of corticosteroids,
the rats’ performance on
memory tests increased at first,
but dropped off at higher doses.
In humans, we see a similar 
positive effect with moderate stress.
But that only appears when 
the stress is related to the memory task—
so while time pressure might 
help you memorize a list,
having a friend scare you will not.
And the weeks, months, or even years
of sustained corticosteroids 
that result from chronic stress
can damage the hippocampus
and decrease your ability 
to form new memories.

It would be nice if some stress 
also helped us remember facts,
but unfortunately, the opposite is true.
The act of remembering relies 
on the prefrontal cortex,
which governs thought, 
attention, and reasoning.
When corticosteroids 
stimulate the amygdala,
the amygdala inhibits, 
or lessens the activity of,
the prefrontal cortex.
The reason for this inhibition
is so the fight/flight/freeze response
can overrule slower, more reasoned 
thought in a dangerous situation.
But that can also have 
the unfortunate effect
of making your mind 
go blank during a test.
And then the act of trying to remember
can itself be a stressor,
leading to a vicious cycle 
of more corticosteroid release
and an even smaller chance of remembering.

So what can you do to turn stress 
to your advantage
and stay calm and collected 
when it matters the most?
First, if you know a stressful
situation like a test is coming,
try preparing in conditions similar 
to the stressful environment.
Novelty can be a stressor.
Completing practice questions 
under time pressure,
or seated at a desk 
rather than on a couch,
can make your stress response
to these circumstances
less sensitive during the test itself.

Exercise is another useful tool.
Increasing your heart 
and breathing rate
is linked to chemical changes 
in your brain
that help reduce anxiety 
and increase your sense of well-being.
Regular exercise is also widely 
thought to improve sleeping patterns,
which comes in handy 
the night before a test.

And on the actual test day,
try taking deep breaths to counteract 
your body’s flight/fight/freeze response.
Deep breathing exercises have shown
measurable reduction in test anxiety
in groups ranging from
third graders to nursing students.

So the next time you find your mind 
going blank at a critical moment,
take a few deep breaths 
until you remember ataraxia:
a state of calmness, free from anxiety.
