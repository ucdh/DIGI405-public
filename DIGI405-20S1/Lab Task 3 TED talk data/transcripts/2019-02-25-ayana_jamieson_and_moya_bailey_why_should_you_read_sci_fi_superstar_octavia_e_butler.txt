Following a devastating nuclear war,
Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis
to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali.
These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA
by breeding with humans
so that each species’ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other.
The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race.
Should humanity take the leap into 
the biological unknown,
or hold on to its identity and perish?

Questions like this haunt 
Octavia Butler’s "Dawn,"
the first in her trilogy "Lilith’s Brood."
A visionary storyteller who 
upended science fiction,
Butler built stunning worlds 
throughout her work–
and explored dilemmas that keep 
us awake at night.

Born in 1947,
Butler grew up shy and introverted in 
Pasadena, California.
She dreamt up stories from an early age,
and was soon scribbling these 
scenarios on paper.
At twelve, she begged her mother 
for a typewriter
after enduring a campy science fiction
film called "Devil Girl From Mars."
Unimpressed with what she saw,
Butler knew she could tell a better story.

Much science fiction features 
white male heroes
who blast aliens or become 
saviors of brown people.
Butler wanted to write diverse characters
for diverse audiences.
She brought nuance and depth to the 
representation of their experiences.

For Butler,
imagination was not only for planting 
the seeds of science fiction–
but also a strategy for surviving an 
unjust world on one’s own terms.
Her work often takes troubling 
features of the world
such as discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, class, or ability,
and invites the reader to contemplate 
them in new contexts.

One of her most beloved novels,
the "Parable of the Sower,"
follows this pattern.
It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina
as she makes her way through a near-future
California, ruined by corporate greed,
inequality, and environmental destruction.
As she struggles with hyperempathy,
or a condition in the novel that 
causes her to feel others’ pain,
and less often, their pleasure.
Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive.
There, they seek to live in accordance 
with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed,
which is based on the principle
that humans must adapt to an 
ever-changing world.

Lauren’s quest had roots 
in a real life event–
California Prop 187,
which attempted to deny undocumented
immigrants fundamental human rights,
before it was deemed unconstitutional.
Butler frequently incorporated 
contemporary news into her writing.
In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the 
Sower," "Parable of the Talents,"
she wrote of a presidential candidate
who controls Americans with virtual 
reality and “shock collars.”
His slogan? “Make America great again.”

While people have noted her prescience,
Butler was also interested in 
re-examining history.
For instance,
"Kindred" tells the story of
a woman who is repeatedly
pulled back in time
to the Maryland plantation 
of her ancestors.
Early on, she learns that her mission 
is to save the life of the white man
who will rape her great grandmother.
If she doesn’t save him, 
she herself will cease to exist.
This grim dilemma forces Dana to 
confront the ongoing trauma
of slavery and sexual violence 
against Black women.

With her stories of women 
founding new societies,
time travelers overcoming 
historical strife,
and interspecies bonding,
Butler had a profound influence on 
the growing popularity of Afrofuturism.
That’s a cultural movement
where Black writers and artists who are 
inspired by the past, present and future,
produce works that incorporate magic, 
history, technology and much more.

As Lauren comes to learn in 
"Parable of the Sower,"
"All that you touch you Change.
All that you Change Changes you.
The only lasting truth is Change.”
