15th century Europeans believed 
they had hit upon a miracle cure:
a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, 
bruising, nausea,
and virtually any other 
medical ailment.
This brown powder could be mixed 
into drinks, made into salves
or eaten straight up.
It was known as mumia and made 
by grinding up mummified human flesh.

The word "cannibal" dates from the 
time of Christopher Columbus;
in fact, Columbus may even have 
coined it himself.
After coming ashore on the 
island of Guadaloupe,
Columbus' initial reports back 
to the Queen of Spain
described the indigenous people as 
friendly and peaceful—
though he did mention rumors of a 
group called the Caribs,
who made violent raids and then cooked 
and ate their prisoners.
In response, Queen Isabella granted 
permission to capture and enslave
anyone who ate human flesh.
When the island failed to produce the gold
Columbus was looking for,
he began to label anyone who resisted his 
plundering and kidnapping as a Caribe.
Somewhere along the way, the word "Carib" 
became "Canibe" and then "Cannibal."
First used by colonizers to dehumanize 
indigenous people,
it has since been applied to anyone 
who eats human flesh.

So the term comes from an account that 
wasn't based on hard evidence,
but cannibalism does have a real and 
much more complex history.
It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, 
as with mumia,
it doesn't involved recognizable parts 
of the human body.
The reasons for cannibalistic practices 
have varied, too.
Across cultures and time periods, there's 
evidence of survival cannibalism,
when people living through a famine, 
siege or ill-fated expedition
had to either eat the bodies of the dead 
or starve to death themselves.
But it's also been quite common 
for cultures
to normalize some form of eating human 
flesh under ordinary circumstances.
Because of false accounts 
like Columbus's,
it's difficult to say exactly how common 
cultural cannibalism has been—
but there are still some examples of 
accepted cannibalistic practices
from within the cultures practicing them.

Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe 
during Columbus's time.
Starting in the 15th century, the demand 
for mumia increased.
At first, stolen mummies from Egypt 
supplied the mumia craze,
but soon the demand was too great to be 
sustained on Egyptian mummies alone,
and opportunists stole bodies from 
European cemeteries to turn into mumia.
Use of mumia continued for 
hundreds of years.
It was listed in the Merck index, 
a popular medical encyclopedia,
into the 20th century.
And ground up mummies were far from 
the only remedy made from human flesh
that was common throughout Europe.
Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, 
was used to treat epilepsy,
while human liver, gall stones, oil 
distilled from human brains,
and pulverized hearts were popular 
medical concoctions.

In China,
the written record of socially accepted 
cannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years.
One particularly common 
form of cannibalism
appears to have been filial cannibalism,
where adult sons and daughters would 
offer a piece of their own flesh
to their parents.
This was typically offered as a last-ditch
attempt to cure a sick parent,
and wasn't fatal to their offspring—
it usually involved flesh from the thigh 
or, less often, a finger.

Cannibalistic funerary rites are another 
form of culturally sanctioned cannibalism.
Perhaps the best-known example came 
from the Fore people of New Guinea.
Through the mid-20th century, members 
of the community would,
if possible, make their funerary 
preferences known in advance,
sometimes requesting that family members
gather to consume the body after death.
Tragically, though these rituals 
honored the deceased,
they also spread a deadly disease known 
as kuru through the community.

Between the fictionalized stories, 
verifiable practices,
and big gaps that still exist 
in our knowledge,
there's no one history of cannibalism.
But we do know that people have 
been eating each other,
volunteering themselves to be eaten,
and accusing others of eating 
people for millennia.
