What shape are your cells?
Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags?
You probably don’t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks,
but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences.
And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better,
others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications.
This is the story of sickle-cell disease.

Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells,
which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body.
To perform this vital task,
red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules.
These proteins float independently
inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape,
keeping the cells flexible enough
to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels.
But in sickle cell disease,
a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin.
After releasing oxygen to tissues,
these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows.
Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle.
These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier,
and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels.
Sickled cells snag and pile up–
sometimes blocking the vessel completely.
This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells,
causing the wide range of symptoms
experienced by people 
with sickle-cell disease.

Starting when they’re 
less than a year old,
patients suffer from repeated episodes of
stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues.
The location of the clogged vessel
determines the specific 
symptoms experienced.
A blockage in the spleen, 
part of the immune system,
puts patients at risk for 
dangerous infections.
A pileup in the lungs can produce 
fevers and difficulty breathing.
A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment.
And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain
the patient could even 
suffer a stroke.

Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long—
just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months.
This short lifespan
means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells;
a condition called sickle-cell anemia.

Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation
is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation.
Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation
to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria.
Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes,
malaria uses red blood cells as incubators
to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream.

However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks
also make them more resistant to malaria.
And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent,
there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin
to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite,
while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function.
In regions rife with this parasite,
sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage.
But as the adaptation flourished,
it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents
resulted in sickle-cell anemia.

Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease
can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic.
And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa,
where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide.
Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives,
our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve.
For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available
to reduce the amount of sickling,
blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy.
Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure,
but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible.
But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways,
like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling,
or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells.
And the ability to edit DNA
has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin.
As these tools become available
in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease,
we can improve the quality of life
for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.
