In the 1600s
the Dutch East India Company 
employed hundreds of ships
to trade gold, porcelain, spices, 
and silks around the globe.
But running this massive 
operation wasn’t cheap.
In order to fund their expensive voyages,
the company turned to private citizens–
individuals who could invest money 
to support the trip
in exchange for a share 
of the ship’s profits.
This practice allowed the company 
to afford even grander voyages,
increasing profits for both 
themselves and their savvy investors.

Selling these shares in coffee houses 
and shipping ports across the continent,
the Dutch East India Company unknowingly
invented the world’s first stock market.
Since then, companies have been 
collecting funds from willing investors
to support all kinds of businesses.
And today,
the stock market has schools, careers,
and even whole television channels
dedicated to understanding it.
But the modern stock market is 
significantly more complicated
than its original incarnation.
So how do companies and investors
use the market today?

Let’s imagine a new coffee company 
that decides to launch on the market.
First, the company will advertise itself 
to big investors.
If they think the company is a good idea,
they get the first crack at investing,
and then sponsor the company’s initial 
public offering, or IPO.
This launches the company onto the 
official public market,
where any company or individual who 
believes the business could be profitable
might buy a stock.
Buying stocks makes those investors 
partial owners in the business.

Their investment helps 
the company to grow,
and as it becomes more successful,
more buyers may see potential 
and start buying stocks.
As demand for those stocks increases,
so does their price, increasing 
the cost for prospective buyers,
and raising the value of the company's 
stocks people already own.
For the company,
this increased interest helps 
fund new initiatives,
and also boosts its overall market value
by showing how many people 
are willing to invest in their idea.

However, if for some reason a company 
starts to seem less profitable
the reverse can also happen.
If investors think their stock 
value is going to decline,
they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes 
of making a profit
before the company loses more value.
As stocks are sold and demand 
for the stock goes down,
the stock price falls,
and with it, the company’s market value.
This can leave investors with big losses–
unless the company starts to look 
profitable again.

This see-saw of supply and demand 
is influenced by many factors.
Companies are under the unavoidable 
influence of market forces–
such as the fluctuating 
price of materials,
changes in production technology,
and the shifting costs of labor.
Investors may be worried about 
changes in leadership,
bad publicity, or larger factors like 
new laws and trade policies.
And of course,
plenty of investors are simply ready 
to sell valuable stocks
and pursue personal interests.
All these variables cause day-to-day noise
in the market,
which can make companies appear more
or less successful.
And in the stock market,
appearing to lose value often leads 
to losing investors,
and in turn, losing actual value.

Human confidence in the market has the
power to trigger
everything from economic booms 
to financial crises.
And this difficult-to-track 
variable
is why most professionals promote 
reliable long term investing
over trying to make quick cash.
However, experts are constantly 
building tools
in efforts to increase their 
chances of success
in this highly unpredictable system.

But the stock market is not just 
for the rich and powerful.
With the dawn of the Internet,
everyday investors can buy stocks
in many of the exact same ways 
a large investor would.
And as more people educate themselves 
about this complex system
they too can trade stocks,
support the businesses they believe in,
and pursue their financial goals.
The first step is getting invested.
