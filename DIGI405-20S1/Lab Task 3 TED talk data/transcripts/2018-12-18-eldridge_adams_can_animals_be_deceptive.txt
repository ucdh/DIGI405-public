A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night,
emitting a series of enticing flashes.
He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow
and mate with him.
Sadly for this male,
it won’t turn out quite the way he plans.
A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns:
by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership,
she lures him in–
and turns him into an easy meal.
He’s been deceived.

Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception
by non-human animals:
it must mislead the receiver,
the deceiver must benefit,
and it can’t simply be an accident.
In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident
because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern
to match males of different species.

Based on this definition,
where is animal deception seen in nature?

Camouflage is a good starting point–
and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery.
The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers
by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest.
Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves.
Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns
resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake
to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey.
Even some plants use mimicry:
there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males,
who end up pollinating the plant.

Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics
that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments.
But in other cases,
the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals
and to adjust its behavior accordingly.
Sensing a threat,
the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings.
Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely
when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake–
birds, after all, 
have better color vision.

One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception
comes from the fork-tailed drongo.
This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert,
surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat.
That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover.
But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm
when those other species 
have captured prey.
As the meerkats and babblers flee,
the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches.
This tactic works about half the time–
and it provides drongos 
with much of their food.

There are fewer solid cases
of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species,
but that happens too.
Consider the mantis shrimp.
Like other crustaceans,
it molts as it grows,
which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack.
But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals.
So it has become a masterful bluffer.
Despite being fragile,
a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders,
spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents.
And that works –
bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers.

In its softened condition,
a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight–
which is why we can be confident
that its behavior is a bluff.
Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical:
newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals,
who are especially likely 
to be driven away.
It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively,
the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior,
to get the best result.

So we know that animals can deceive,
but do they do so with intent?
That’s a difficult question,
and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it.
We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts.
But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception.
By watching behavior and its outcomes,
we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals,
and that their capacity for deception
can be surprisingly complex.
