Well, hello.
This is Sophie.
It's all right, don't worry,
everything's going to be fine.

(Laughter)

There are some people on the balcony
that are very happy to be up there now.

(Laughter)

So this is Sophie —
not Sophia — no, Sophie.
She has a French name.
And you wonder why?

(Laughter)

So Sophie, for most people,
is the incarnation of terror, really.
She's far too leggy, she's far too hairy,
and she's far too big to ever be trusted.
But to me, Sophie is a fantastic
feat of bioengineering.
You see, Sophie is a testimony
to all those creatures
that have managed to survive
since the beginning of time;
all those animals
that have managed to have offspring
generation after generation,
until this day.

You see, over one billion years ago,
the first primitive cells
started to evolve on this planet.
It took spiders 430 million years
to become what they are now:
one of the most versatile,
one of the most diverse
and one of the most evolved groups —

(Laughter)

of predators to ever walk this earth.

It's actually quite sporty
to give a speech
while wrangling a tarantula,
I have to say.

(Laughter)

So, we shouldn't forget that Sophie —
and in fact, all of us —
we all are a testimony
to all those ruthless battles
that actually were won
consistently by all our ancestors,
all our predecessors.
In fact, all of us,
every single one of you,
is in fact an uninterrupted,
one-billion-years-old success story.
And in the gaze of Sophie,
that success is partly due
to what she has in her chest,
just under her eyes.
In there, she has a pair of venom glands
that are attached to a pair of fangs,
and those fangs are folded into her mouth.
So, without those fangs
and without this venom,
Sophie would have never
managed to survive.

Now, many animals have evolved
venom systems in order to survive.
Nowadays, any species of venomous snakes,
any species of spider,
any species of scorpion,
has its own venom signature, if you will,
made out of dozens, if not hundreds,
of chemical compounds.
And all of those compounds
have evolved purely for one purpose:
disable and, eventually, kill.

Now, venom can actually act
in many different ways.
Venom, believe me, can make you feel
pains that you've never felt before.
Venom can also make
your heart stop within minutes,
or it can turn your blood into jelly.
Venom can also paralyze you
almost instantly,
or it can just eat
your flesh away, like acid.
Now, all of these are pretty
gruesome stories, I know,
but, to me, it's kind of music to my ears.
It's what I love.
So why is that?
Well, it's not because I'm a nutcase, no.

(Laughter)

Just imagine what we could do
if we could harvest
all those super powerful compounds
and use them to our benefit.
That would be amazing, right?
What if we could, I don't know,
produce new antibiotics with those venoms?
What if we could actually help people
that are suffering from diabetes
or hypertension?
Well, in fact, all those applications
are already being developed
by scientists just like me
everywhere around the world, as I speak.
You see, hypertension is actually treated
regularly with a medication
that has been developed from the toxin
that is produced
by a South American viper.
People that have type 2 diabetes
can be monitored using, actually,
the toxin produced
by a lizard from North America.
And in hospitals all around the world,
a new protocol is being developed
to use a toxin from
a marine snail for anesthetics.

You see, venom is that kind of huge
library of chemical compounds
that are available to us,
that are produced by hundreds
of thousands of live creatures.
And —

Oh, sorry, she just wants
to go for a little walk.

(Laughter)

Spiders alone are actually
thought to produce
over 10 million different
kinds of compounds
with potential therapeutic application.
10 million.
And do you know how many scientists
actually have managed to study so far?
About 0.01 percent.
So that means that there is still
99.99 percent of all those compounds
that are out there, completely unknown,
and are just waiting
to be harvested and tested,
which is fantastic.
You see, so far, scientists
have concentrated their efforts
on very charismatic,
very dangerous animals —
vipers and cobras or scorpions
and black widows.
But what about all those little bugs
that we actually have all around us?
You know, like that spider
that lives behind your couch?
You know, the one that decides
to just shoot through the floor
when you're watching TV
and freaks you out?
Ah, you have that one at home as well.

(Laughter)

Well, what about those guys?
Do they actually produce
some kind of amazing compound
in their tiny body as well?
Well, an honest answer a few months ago
would have been, "We have no clue."
But now that my students and myself
have started to look into it,
I can tell you those guys
actually are producing
very, very interesting compounds.
And I'm going to tell you
more about that in a second,
but first, I would like to tell you more
about this "we are looking into it."
How does one look into it?

Well, first of all, my students and I
have to capture a lot of spiders.
So how do we do that?
Well, you'd be surprised.
Once one starts to look,
one finds a lot of spiders.
They actually live everywhere around us.
Within a couple of hours,
we are capable of catching maybe
two, three, four hundred spiders,
and we bring them back to my laboratory,
and we house each of them
in its own individual home.
And we give each of them a little meal.
So now I know what you're thinking:
"This guy's nuts.
He has a spider B&B at work ..."

(Laughter)

No, no it's not exactly that,
and it's not the kind of venture
I would advise you to start.
No, once we're done with that,
we wait a few days,
and then, we anesthetize those spiders.
Once they're asleep, we run a tiny
little electric current through their body
and that contracts their venom glads.
Then, under a microscope, we can see
a tiny little droplet of venom appearing.
So we take a hair-thin
glass tube, a capillary,
and we collect that tiny droplet.
Then, we take the spider
and we put it back into its home,
and we start again with another one.
Because spiders are completely
unharmed during the process,
it means that a few days later,
once they've produced a little bit
of venom again and they've recovered,
we can release them back into the wild.

It takes literally hundreds of spiders
to just produce the equivalent
of one raindrop of venom.
So that drop is incredibly precious to us.
And once we have it, we freeze it,
and we then pass it in a machine
that will separate and purify every
chemical compound that is in that venom.
We're speaking about tiny amounts.
We're actually speaking about a tenth
of a millionth of a liter of compound,
but we can dilute that compound
several thousand times
in its own volume of water
and then test it against
a whole range of nasty stuff,
like cancer cells or bacteria.
And this is when the very exciting
part of my job starts,
because this is pure scientific gambling.
It's kind of "Las Vegas, baby," for me.

(Laughter)

We spend so many hours, so much resources,
so much time trying to get
those compounds ready,
and then we test them.
And most of the time, nothing happens.
Nothing at all.
But once in a while —
just once in a while,
we get that particular compound
that has absolutely amazing effects.
That's the jackpot.
And when I'm saying that, actually,
I should take out something
else from my pocket —
be afraid, be very afraid.

(Laughter)

Now, in that little tube,
I have, actually, a very common spider.
The kind of spider
that you could find in your shed,
that you could find in your basement
or that you could find in your sewer pipe,
understand: in your toilet.
Now, that little spider happens to produce
amazingly powerful
antimicrobial compounds.
It is even capable of killing
those drug-resistant bacteria
that are giving us so much trouble,
that are often making media headlines.
Now, honestly, if I was living
in your sewer pipe,
I'd produce antibiotics, too.

(Laughter)

But that little spider,
may actually hold the answer
to a very, very serious concern we have.
You see, around the world,
every single day,
about 1,700 people die because of
antimicrobial-resistant infections.
Multiply that by 365,
and you're reaching the staggering number
of 700,000 people dead every single year
because antibiotics that were efficient
30, 20 or 10 years ago
are not capable of killing
very common bugs.
The reality is that the world
is running out of antibiotics,
and the pharmaceutical industry
does not have any answer,
actually, any weapon
to address that concern.
You see, 30 years ago,
you could consider that 10 to 15
new kinds of antibiotics
would hit the market
every couple of years.
Do you know how many of them
hit the market in the past five years?
Two.
The reality is
that if we continue this way,
we are a few decades away
from being completely helpless
in front of infections,
just like we were before the discovery
of penicillin 90 years ago.

So you see, the reality
is that we are at war
against an invisible enemy
that adapts and evolves
a lot quicker than we do.
And in that war,
this little spider might be
one of our greatest secret weapons.
Just a half a millionth
of a liter of a venom,
diluted 10,000 times,
is still capable of killing most bacteria
that are resistant
to any other kind of antibiotics.
It's absolutely amazing.
Every time I repeat
this experiment, I just wonder:
How is that possible?
How many other possibilities and secrets
do the siblings actually have?
What kind of wonderful product
can we really find, if we care to look?

So when people ask me, "Are bugs
really the future of therapeutic drugs?"
my answer is, "Well, I really believe
that they do hold some key answers."
And we need to really give ourselves
the means to investigate them.
So when you head back home later tonight,
and you see that spider
in the corner of your room ...

(Laughter)

don't squash it.

(Laughter)

Just look at it, admire it
and remember that it is
an absolutely fantastic creature,
a pure product of evolution,
and that maybe that very spider,
one day, will hold the answer,
will hold the key
to your very own survival.
You see, she's not so insignificant
anymore now, is she?

(Laughter)

Thank you.

(Applause)
