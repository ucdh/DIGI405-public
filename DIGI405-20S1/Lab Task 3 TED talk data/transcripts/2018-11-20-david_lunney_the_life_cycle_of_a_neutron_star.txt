About once every century,
a massive star somewhere in our galaxy

runs out of fuel.
This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure
have fused the star’s hydrogen
into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron.
No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure,
it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova.
The star shoots most of its 
innards into space,
seeding the galaxy with heavy elements.
But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable:
a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons
collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei.
The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star:
one of the densest known objects 
in the universe,
and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter.

But what is a neutron star?
Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons
and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid—
surrounded by a crust.
This material is incredibly dense –
the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship
squeezed into a human hair,
or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube.
Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases
that physicists call “nuclear pasta,”
as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes.

The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin.
When they collapse,
stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide
compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across.
But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved.
So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates
when they bring in their arms,
the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent.
The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second,
which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space
at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light.
Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object.
This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes
that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles.
Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star,
the beams spin like lighthouse beacons,
which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth.
We call those pulsars.
The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals
by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967
was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars
in the first place.
An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years
as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves.

But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly.
For example, we’ve observed binary systems
where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star.
A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion,
gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere
before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole.

While many stars exist as binary systems,
only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries,
where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger.
When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time
like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake.

Einstein’s theory of General Relativity
predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified
until 2017,
when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO
observed a neutron star collision.
Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light,
and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact.
That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy.
It yielded a treasure trove of data
that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity,
bolster important theories 
in astrophysics,
and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum.

Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet.
LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions.
That’ll help us learn what else
the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets
can tell us about the universe.
