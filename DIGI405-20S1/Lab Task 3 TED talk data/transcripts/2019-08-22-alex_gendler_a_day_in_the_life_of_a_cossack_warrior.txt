Despite a serene sunset 
on the Dnipro river,
the mood is tense for the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks.
The year is 1676, and the Treaty of 
Żurawno has officially ended hostilities
between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
and the Ottoman Empire.
But as Stepan and his men ride 
towards their stronghold,
peace is far from their minds.

Having made their home in the Wild Fields 
north of the Black Sea,
these cossacks— derived from a Turkic 
word for "free man"—
are renowned as one of Europe’s most 
formidable military forces.
Composed of hunters, fishermen, 
nomads and outlaws,
the Cossacks found freedom in these 
fertile unclaimed lands.
Yet this freedom has proven increasingly 
difficult to maintain.
Their decades-long strategy of shifting 
alliances between Poland and Moscow
has led to the partitioning 
of their lands.
In a desperate bid to reclaim independence
and reunite the fractured Cossack state,
their most recent leader, hetman Petro 
Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire.
This alliance successfully freed the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks
in the west from Polish dominion, but 
their victory was a bitter one.
Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies 
ravaged the countryside,
carrying off peasants into slavery.
And outrage at allying with Muslims 
against fellow Christians
cost him any remaining local support.
Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled,
the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing 
on what their next move should be.

Until then, Stepan must keep order.
With his musket and curved saber, 
he cuts an imposing figure.
He surveys his battalion of 180 men.
Most are Orthodox Christians 
and speak a Slavic language
that will become modern Ukrainian.
But there are also Greeks, Tatars, 
and even some Mongolian Kalmyks,
many with different opinions 
on recent events.
Officially, all of Stepan’s men have 
sworn to uphold the Cossack code
by undergoing seven years of military 
training and remaining unmarried.
In practice, some are part-timers, holding
more closely to their own traditions,
and maintaining families in nearby 
villages, outside Cossack lands.

Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not 
broken before they reach the Sich—
the center of Cossack military life.
Currently located at Chortomlyk,
the Sich’s location shifts with 
the tide of military action.
The settlement is remarkably well-
organized, with administrative buildings,
officers’ quarters, and even schools, 
as Cossacks prize literacy.
Stepan and his men make their way 
to the barracks where they live and train
alongside several other 
battalions or kurins,
all of which make up a several 
hundred man regiment.

Inside, the men dine on dried fish, 
sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat—
along with plenty of wine.
Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to 
lighten the mood with his bandura.
But before long, an argument 
has broken out.
One of his men has raised 
a toast to Doroshenko.
Stepan cuts him off.
The room is silent until he raises 
his own toast to Ivan Sirko,
the new hetman who favors an alliance 
with Moscow against the Turks.
Stepan plans to support him, and 
he expects his men to do the same.

Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in,
calling an emergency Rada, 
or general council meeting.
Stepan and the others make their 
way towards the church square—
the center of Sich life.
Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused 
crowd with exciting news—
scouts have located a large Ottoman 
camp completely vulnerable on one side.
Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will 
ride against their common enemy,
defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, 
and bring unity to the Wild Fields.
As the men cheer in unison,
Stepan is relieved at their renewed 
sense of brotherhood.

Over the next 200 years, these 
freedom fighters would take on many foes.
And tragically,
they would eventually become the 
oppressive hand of the Russian government
they once opposed.
But today, these 17th century Cossacks
are remembered for their spirit of 
independence and defiance.
As the Russian painter 
Ilya Repin once said:
“No people in the world held freedom, 
equality, and fraternity so deeply.”
