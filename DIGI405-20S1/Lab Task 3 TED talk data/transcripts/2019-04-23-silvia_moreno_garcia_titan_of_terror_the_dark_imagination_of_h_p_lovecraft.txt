Arcane books of forbidden lore,
disturbing secrets in 
the family bloodline,
and terrors so unspeakable the very 
thought of them might drive you mad.
By now, these have become standard 
elements in many modern horror stories.
But they were largely popularized 
by a single author–
one whose name has become an adjective
for the particular type of 
terror he inspired.

Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890,
Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories
written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers.
But by the time he began writing in 1917,
World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts.
People had seen real horrors,
and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore.
Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror,
one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era.
His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility.
In "The Colour out of Space,"
a strange meteorite falls near 
a farmhouse,
mutating the farm into a 
nightmarish hellscape.
Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form.
"At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition
that unearths things better 
left undiscovered.
In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror,
as impossible geometric configurations
wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them.
Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays,
the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction 
were powerful,
yet often invisible and indescribable.
Rather than recognizable monsters,
graphic violence, or startling shocks,
the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed–
but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination.

Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems
often take place in the same 
fictional continuity,
with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies.
At first glance,
they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s 
contemporary New England.
But beneath the surface of this seemingly 
similar reality lie dark masters,
for whom Earth’s inhabitants 
are mere playthings.

More like primordial forces 
than mere deities,
Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at 
the corners of our reality.
Beings such as Yog-Sothoth,
“who froths as primal slime 
in nuclear chaos
beyond the nethermost outposts 
of space and time.”
Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth,
whose destructive impulses are 
stalled only by
the “maddening beating of vile drums
and the thin monotonous whine 
of accursed flutes.”

These beings exist beyond our 
conceptions of reality,
their true forms as inscrutable 
as their motives.
Lovecraft’s protagonists–
often researchers, anthropologists, 
or antiquarians–
stumble onto hints of their existence.
But even these indirect glimpses are 
enough to drive them insane.
And if they survive,
the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference–
the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks
at the mercy of unfathomable forces.
But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had
was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries.
During his lifetime,
Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers,
encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own.
References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes
can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals,
such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch.
Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos,
named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus.

Unfortunately,
Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression
in his personal views.
The author held strong racist views,
and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs.
But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices.
And after Lovecraft’s death,
the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors,
often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives
that transcend the author’s prejudices.

Despite his literary legacy,
Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success.
He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46–
a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference.
But his work has inspired numerous 
short stories, novels,
tabletop games, and cultural icons.
And as long as humans feel a sense of 
dread about our unknown future,
Lovecraftian horror will have a place in 
the darkest corners of our imagination.
