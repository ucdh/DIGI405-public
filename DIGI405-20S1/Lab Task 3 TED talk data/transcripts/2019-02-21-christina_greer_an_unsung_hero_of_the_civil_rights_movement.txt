On August 28th, 1963,
Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech
at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom.
That day,

nearly a quarter million people
gathered on the national mall
to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence,
and economic exclusion 
black people still faced
across the United States.
None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer
– a man named Bayard Rustin.

Rustin grew up in a Quaker household,
and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school.
He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life,
and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II.
During his two-year imprisonment,
he protested the segregated 
facilities from within.

Wherever Rustin went,
he organized and advocated, 

and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people
who could help further 
messages of equality.
He joined the Communist Party
when black American’s civil rights 
were one of its priorities,
but soon became disillusioned by the 
party’s authoritarian leanings
and left.
In 1948,
he traveled to India to learn the 
peaceful resistance strategies
of the recently assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi.
He returned to the United States

armed with strategies 
for peaceful protest,
including civil disobedience.

He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955,
and shared these ideas with him.
As King’s prominence increased,
Rustin became his main advisor,
as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement.
He brought his organizing expertise 

to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama
—in fact,
he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest
that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before.

His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963,
when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington.
The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers
and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern.
Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare,
but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals.
In spite of his deft management,
some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front
with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality.

Despite these slights,
Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march
he delivered the
marchers' demands
in a speech directed at 
President John F. Kennedy.
The march itself proceeded smoothly,
without any violence.
It has been credited with helping pass 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which ended segregation in public places 
and banned employment discrimination,
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act,
which outlawed discriminatory 
voting practices.

In spite of his decades of service,
Rustin’s positions on certain political 
issues were unpopular among his peers.
Some thought he wasn’t critical enough 
of the Vietnam War,
or that he was too eager to collaborate
with the political establishment
including the president and congress.
Others were uncomfortable with his 
former communist affiliation.
But ultimately,

both his belief
in collaboration
with the government 
and his membership
to the communist party
had been driven by his desire
to maximize tangible gains
in liberties for black Americans,
and to do so as quickly as possible.

Rustin was passed over for several 
influential roles in the 1960s and 70s,
but he never stopped his activism.
In the 1980s,
he publicly came out as gay,
and was instrumental
in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis
until his death in 1987.
In 2013,
fifty years after the March On Washington,
President Barack Obama posthumously 
awarded him
the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
praising Rustin’s 
“march towards true equality,
no matter who we are 
or who we love.”
