Whether or not you realize it,
as a surfer you’re a master 
of complicated physics.

The science of surfing begins

as soon as you and your board 
first hit the water.
The board’s size and light construction 
help it displace a lot of water.
In turn, a buoyant force
equal to the weight of the 
displaced water pushes up,
counteracting you and your board’s weight.
This lets you stay afloat while 
you wait to paddle for a wave.

And what exactly are you waiting for?
The perfect wave, of course.
Like other waves in physics, ocean waves
represent a transfer of energy.
Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates 
water particles near the surface,
leading to the growth of ripples 
that become waves.
These deviations from the flat surface 
are acted upon by gravity,
which tries to restore the surface 
to its original flat state.
As the waves then move through the water,
particles push and pull on their neighbors
through the wave induced pressure,
and this motion propagates energy through 
the water in unison with the wave motion.
The motion of these particles
is much more limited than the 
overall motion of the waves.
Near the shore,
the shallower seafloor constrains 
the motion of the waves
to occur in a more limited region 
than out at sea,
concentrating the wave energy 
near the surface.
If the topography of the shoreline 
is even and smooth,
this will refract the waves 
to become more
parallel to the shore as they approach.

This is the crucial moment.
As the wave gets near,
you quickly pivot your board 
in the same direction as the wave
and paddle to match its speed.
Your board forms an angle with the water,
and this creates a dynamic pressure 
on the bottom of it,
forcing you and your board 
out of the water,
to skim along the surface.
At the same time,
your increased forward momentum 
makes you more stable,
allowing you to stand up 
and surf along the wave.

Now you’ve caught the wave,
and are riding along its front 
face parallel to the shoreline.
Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter 
your speed and direction
by repositioning your weight.
Above you is the wave’s crest,
where the water particles are undergoing
their greatest acceleration.
That forces them to move faster 
than the underlying wave,
so they shoot ahead before falling under
gravity’s influence.
This forms the waves’ characteristic
curls, or jets,
as they break along the shore.
Sometimes, the curl might completely 
enclose part of the wave,
forming a moving tube of water 
known as the barrel.
Because of irregularities in the seafloor 
and the swell itself,
few barrels last as long as the legendary 
27-second ride off the coast of Namibia.
But many who manage to get barreled
have said they feel time 
passing differently inside,
making it one of the most magical 
experiences a surfer can have.

Of course,
not all beaches are created equal.
Offshore underwater canyons or rock
formations
in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal
or Mavericks, California
refract the incoming wave energy 
into a single spot,
creating massive waves 
sought by surfers worldwide.
And some of these waves travel 
for more than a week,
with swells originating more than 10,000 
kilometers away from shore.
Waves surfed in sunny California
may have originated in the stormy 
seas near New Zealand.

So while you may not be thinking about 
weather patterns in the South Pacific,
tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics,
the art of catching the perfect wave 
relies on all these things and more.
And the waves we surf, created by wind,
are just one visible part of the 
continuous oscillation of energy
that has shaped our universe 
since its very beginning.
