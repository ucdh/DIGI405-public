It’s an incredible discovery:
an ancient, abandoned alien space station 
filled with precursor technology.
But now, every species in the galaxy is 
in a mad dash to get there first
and claim it for themselves.

And right away, you’ve got a problem.
Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive 
consumes 1 unit of fuel
for every parsec of distance it takes you,
and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel.
But the space station is 23 parsecs away,
and there’s only empty space between 
there and here.

There’s one thing that can 
help you, though:
dark matter fuel is stable in deep space.
That means you can vent a cache of it 
from your fuel chamber,
and then come back to pick 
it up again later.
Even though your ship holds 
only 15 units of fuel,
you’ve been granted use of all 45 units 
in your current location.
With some strategic fuel caching 
along the way,
you might be able to 
make it all 23 parsecs.

So how can you reach the 
alien space station?
Answer in 3,
2,
1.

It’s possible to solve this riddle using 
as few as two cache points,
and there are also valid solutions 
that use more.
No matter how you go about it though,
the key is determining exactly where 
to cache fuel along your route.

Let’s work backwards from the 
alien space station.
To reach 23 parsecs,
you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec 
mark with a full tank of fuel.
The 8-parsec point is too far from the 
start to use as a cache right away;
you could jump there, but wouldn’t have 
enough fuel to return to the start,
let alone store any for later.
So that means you’ll need to find a cache 
somewhere between the start and 8.
But where?

There’s an interesting pattern 
that can help.
At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ 
worth of fuel.
At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1.
Is there a point, which we can call 
point X, where you could have exactly 2?
That would be useful, because then you 
could refuel there exactly twice,
making full use of your storage capacity 
without any waste.

Wherever point X is,
you’ll jump forward from it twice:
once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec 
cache point, and a second time for good.
So you’ll jump the distance between X and 
8-parsecs 3 times in all.
You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and
need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point,
so you can spend one tank— or 15 units— 
going back and forth.
Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5,
we can place these two cache points 
5 parsecs apart.
Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough 
fuel to reach the alien space station.

So it looks like the earliest we can place
point X is at the 3-parsec mark.
Is it possible to transport 30 units of 
fuel there? Let’s try.

You set out with a full tank of 15 units.
You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units 
off at the cache point,
and then jump the 3 units home, 
arriving with an empty tank.
Repeating this process gets you 18 units 
of fuel at the cache point,
and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec
cache with 30 total units of fuel.
So far so good!

Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark,
drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump 
back to the 3-parsec mark.
You fill up your tank and 
jump forward again,
arriving with 10 units of 
fuel in your tank.

And now the end is in sight.
You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep 
space to fill your tank to capacity,
and type in the coordinates of 
your final destination.
A 15-parsec jump leaves you 
running on fumes,
but ready to dock with the 
precursor space station.

Time to put this alien tech to work
and make life better for everyone 
in the galaxy.
