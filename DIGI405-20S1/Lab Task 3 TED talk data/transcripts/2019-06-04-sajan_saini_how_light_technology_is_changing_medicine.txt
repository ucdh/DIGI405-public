It’s an increasingly common sight 
in hospitals around the world:
a nurse measures our height, 
weight, blood pressure,
and attaches a glowing plastic 
clip to our finger.
Suddenly, a digital screen reads out 
the oxygen level in our bloodstream.
How did that happen?
How can a plastic clip learn something 
about our blood…
without a blood sample?

Here’s the trick:
our bodies are translucent,
meaning they don’t completely 
block and reflect light.
Rather, they allow some light to actually
pass through our skin,
muscles, and blood vessels.
Don’t believe it?
Hold a flashlight to your thumb.

Light, it turns out, can help probe the
insides of our bodies.

Consider that medical fingerclip—
it’s called a pulse oximeter.
When you inhale, your lungs transfer 
oxygen into hemoglobin molecules,
and the pulse oximeter measures the ratio 
of oxygenated to oxygen-free hemoglobin.
It does this by using a tiny red LED light
on one side of the fingerclip,
and a small light detector on the other.

When the LED shines into your finger,
oxygen-free hemoglobin in your blood 
vessels absorbs the red light
more strongly than its oxygenated 
counterpart.
So the amount of light that makes
it out the other side
depends on the concentration ratio 
of the two types of hemoglobin.

But any two patients will have different-sized 
blood vessels in their fingers.
For one patient, a saturation reading of 
ninety-five percent
corresponds to a healthy oxygen level,
but for another with smaller arteries,
the same reading could dangerously 
misrepresent the actual oxygen level.

This can be accounted for with a second 
infrared wavelength LED.
Light comes in a vast spectrum 
of wavelengths,
and infrared light lies just beyond 
the visible colors.
All molecules, including hemoglobin,
absorb light at different efficiencies 
across this spectrum.
So contrasting the absorbance of red 
to infrared light
provides a chemical fingerprint to 
eliminate the blood vessel size effect.

Today, an emerging medical sensor industry
is exploring all-new degrees
of precision chemical fingerprinting,
using tiny light-manipulating devices 
no larger than a tenth of a millimeter.
This microscopic technology,
called integrated photonics,
is made from wires of silicon 
that guide light—
like water in a pipe—
to redirect, reshape, even 
temporarily trap it.

A ring resonator device, 
which is a circular wire of silicon,
is a light trapper that enhances chemical 
fingerprinting.
When placed close to a silicon wire,
a ring siphons off and temporarily stores 
only certain waves of light—
those whose periodic wavelength 
fits a whole number of times
along the ring’s circumference.
It’s the same effect at work when
we pluck guitar strings.
Only certain vibrating patterns dominate 
a string of a particular length,
to give a fundamental 
note and its overtones.

Ring resonators were originally 
designed
to efficiently route different 
wavelengths of light—
each a channel of digital data—
in fiber optics communication networks.
But some day this kind of data 
traffic routing
may be adapted for miniature chemical
fingerprinting labs,
on chips the size of a penny.
These future labs-on-a-chip may easily, 
rapidly,
and non-invasively detect a host 
of illnesses,
by analyzing human saliva or sweat 
in a doctor’s office
or the convenience of our homes.

Human saliva in particular
mirrors the composition of our bodies’ 
proteins and hormones,
and can give early-warning signals for 
certain cancers
and infectious and autoimmune diseases.
To accurately identify an illness,
labs-on-a-chip may rely on 
several methods,
including chemical fingerprinting,
to sift through the large mix of trace 
substances in a sample of spit.

Various biomolecules in saliva absorb 
light at the same wavelength—
but each has a distinct chemical 
fingerprint.
In a lab-on-a-chip, after the light passes
through a saliva sample,
a host of fine-tuned rings
may each siphon off a slightly different
wavelength of light
and send it to a partner light detector.
Together, this bank of detectors will 
resolve
the cumulative chemical fingerprint 
of the sample.
From this information, 
a tiny on-chip computer,
containing a library of chemical 
fingerprints for different molecules,
may figure out their relative 
concentrations,
and help diagnose a specific illness.

From globe-trotting communications 
to labs-on-a-chip,
humankind has repurposed light to both 
carry and extract information.
Its ability to illuminate continues 
to astonish us with new discoveries.
