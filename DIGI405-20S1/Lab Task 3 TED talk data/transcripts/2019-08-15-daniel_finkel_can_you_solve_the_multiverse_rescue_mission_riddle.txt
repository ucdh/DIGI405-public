It was a normal Tuesday 
at the superconductor,
until a bug in the system created 
a small situation.
Now your team is trapped in eleven 
separate pocket dimensions.
Luckily for you, there’s a half-finished 
experimental teleportation robot
that may be able to get you all home,
if you can figure out how to work through
the quirks of its design.

Over interdimensional radio,
your engineers explain
that the robot can teleport into the 
alternate universes you’re trapped in,
but it’ll do so completely at random.
The robot has two levers 
and one big button.
When it appears,
you just switch the position of one 
of the levers from A to B or vice versa,
and then the robot will note your 
dimensional position
and teleport to another of the eleven 
dimensions at random.
If it shows up again, you’ll have to pull 
a lever before it’ll teleport away.
When anyone presses the button,
the robot will bring everyone who pulled
a lever back home.
Anyone who didn’t will be lost 
in the multi-verse forever.

The challenge is to make sure everyone
has pulled a lever
before anyone hits the button.
While you can talk to each other now
over the interdimensional radio
and agree on a plan,
the robot’s teleportation technology
will interfere with all attempts 
at communication once it arrives.
You won’t be able to attach messages 
to the robot
or scratch notes into its superstrong
alloy body.
Your only way to communicate information
is to change the position of exactly 
one lever or hit the button.

What plan will make sure 
everyone gets home?

Pause the video now if you want to
figure it out for yourself.

It would be nice if you could set 
different combinations of the levers
to indicate who’s already 
been visited by the robot.
But it has only two levers.
That gives four combinations—
far too few to communicate 
about 11 people,
especially when you’re forced to flip 
one to send the robot onward.
There must be another way.

The critical insight is that not
everyone has to know
when every pocket dimension
has been visited.
If one person accepts responsibility 
ahead of time for hitting the button,
then only they need to know who the robot
has visited.
In fact, they don’t even need to know 
exactly who’s been visited…
just how many people have been.

You volunteer to be the person in charge 
of pressing the button
when the moment is right,
and give the following directions
to everyone else.
Your plan is simple:
you’ll use the left lever to count visits,
and the right lever will have no meaning,
so there’s no harm in 
moving it up or down.
Each of the others will pull the left
lever
from position A to position 
B exactly once.
If the robot appears with the left lever
already pulled down,
or if an individual has previously pulled
the left lever down
at any point in the past,
then they should move the right lever.
You, meanwhile, will be the only one who 
ever resets the left lever from position B
to position A.
This gives you a way to count how many 
people have been visited by the robot.
Everyone needs to pull the left lever 
down exactly once,
and you’re the only one 
to pull it back up.
So you know that the tenth time 
the robot visits you
with its left lever in the down position,
it must have visited 
all ten of the others.
And that means you’re safe to press the 
button and teleport everyone home.
It may take a while–
most likely the robot will need to 
teleport around 355 times;
but better that than leave anyone behind.
Your teammates phase back into your home
dimension one at a time.
The mission proves a great success.
Well...mostly.
