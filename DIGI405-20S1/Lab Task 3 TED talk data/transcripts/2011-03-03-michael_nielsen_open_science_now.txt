Well, good afternoon, everybody.
Thank you all very much
for coming along today.
I'd like to begin my talk with a story.
It's a story that begins,
but does not end,
with a mathematician named Tim Gowers.
Gowers is one of the world's most
renowned mathematicians.
He's a professor at Cambridge University
and a recipient of the Fields Medal,
often called the Nobel Prize
of mathematics.
Gowers is also a blogger,
and in January of 2009, he used his blog
to pose a very striking question:
Is massively collaborative
mathematics possible?

So what he was proposing in this post
was to use his blog to attack a difficult
unsolved mathematical problem —
a problem which he said
he would "love to solve" —
completely in the open,
using his blog to post his ideas
and his partial progress.
What's more, he issued an open invitation,
inviting anybody in the world who thought
that they had an idea to contribute
to post their idea
in the comment section of the blog.
His hope was that by combining
the ideas of many minds,
he could make easy work
of his hard mathematical problem.
He called this experiment
the Polymath Project.

Well, the Polymath Project
got off to a slow start.
In the first seven hours,
nobody posted any comments.
But then, a mathematician
from the University of British Columbia
named Jozsef Solymosi
posted a short comment.
And this seemed to break the ice,
because a few minutes later,
a high school teacher named
Jason Dyer posted a suggestion.
And a few minutes after that,
another mathematician named
Terence Tao, also a Fields medalist,
posted an idea.
And things really started
to move quickly at this point.
Over the next 37 days,
27 different people would post
800 substantive comments
containing 170,000 words.
I was not a serious participant,
but I was following along closely
from the start,
and it was just amazing.
The speed with which an idea
would be tentatively proposed
and then really rapidly developed
by other people and improved,
sometimes discarded —
it was just amazing.
Gowers described the process
as being to ordinary research
"as driving is to pushing a car."

(Laughter)

At the end of the 37 days,
Gowers used his blog to announce
that they had solved the core problem;
in fact, they had solved a harder
generalization of the problem.
The Polymath Project had succeeded.
So what the Polymath Project
suggests, at least to me,
is that we can use
the internet to build tools
that actually expand our ability
to solve the most challenging
intellectual problems.
Or, to put it in another way:
we can build tools which actively amplify
our collective intelligence
in much the same way as, for millennia,
we've used physical tools
to amplify our strength.
OK?
So what I'd like to talk about today,
or what I'd like to explore today,
is what this means for science.
It's much more important than just solving
a single mathematical problem.
It means an expansion in the range
of scientific problems
we can hope to attack at all.
It means, potentially, an acceleration
in the rate of scientific discovery.
It means a change in the way
we construct knowledge itself.

So, before I get too overexcited, however,
I would like to talk
about some of the challenges,
some of the problems.
Particularly, I'd like to describe
a failure of this approach.
It occurred in 2005, or started in 2005.
A grad student at Caltech named
John Stockton had a very good idea
for what he called the "Quantum Wiki,"
or "Qwiki" for short.

(Laughter)

OK? It's a great idea.
What he did with the Qwiki was —
the idea of the Qwiki was that it
was going to be a great repository
of human knowledge,
much like Wikipedia.
But instead of being focused
on general knowledge,
it was going to be focused on
specialist knowledge in quantum computing.
It was going be kind of
a supertextbook for the field,
with information about
all the latest research,
about what the big open problems
in the field were,
people's speculation
about how to solve the problems,
and so on.
Like Wikipedia, the intention was
that it would be written by the users,
in this case, by experts
in quantum computing.
I was present at the conference at Caltech
in 2005, when it was announced.
And some of the people who I spoke to
were very skeptical,
but some of the people
were very excited by the idea.
They were impressed by the implementation;
they were impressed by the amount
of initial seed material
which had been put on the site;
and most of all,
they were excited by the vision.
But just because they were excited,
didn't mean they wanted
to take the time themselves to contribute.
They hoped that other people would do so.
And in the end, nobody, essentially,
was really all that interested
in contributing.
If you look today,
except in a few small corners,
the Qwiki is essentially dead.

And, sad to say,
this is quite a common story.
Many scientists, in fields ranging
from genetics to string theory,
have tried to start science wikis
along very similar lines.
And typically, they've failed
for essentially the same reason.
It's not just science wikis, either.
Inspired by Facebook,
many organizations have tried to create
social networks for scientists,
which will connect scientists
to other people with similar interests.
So they can share things like data
or code, their ideas and so on.
Again, it sounds like a good idea.
But if you join one of these sites,
you'll quickly discover
that they're essentially empty.
They're virtual ghost towns.
So what's going on?
What's the problem here?
Why are these promising sites failing?

Well, imagine that you're
an ambitious young scientist.
In fact, I know some of you here
are ambitious young scientists.
Imagine you're
an ambitious young scientist.
You really would like to get a job —
a permanent job, a good job —
doing the work that you love.
But it's incredibly competitive
to get such jobs.
Often, there'll be hundreds of very
highly qualified applicants for positions.
And so you find yourself working
60, 70, 80 hours a week,
doing the one thing that you know
will get you such a job,
and that is writing scientific papers.
You may think that the Qwiki
is a wonderful idea in principle,
but you also know that writing
a single mediocre paper
will do much more for your career
and your job prospects
than a long series of brilliant
contributions to such a site.
So even though you may like the idea
and you may think it will advance
science more quickly,
you find you just can't conceive of it
as being part of your job.
It's not.

The only things which can succeed
in this kind of environment
are projects like the Polymath Project,
which, even though they employ
an unconventional means to an end,
they have an essential
conservatism about them.
The end product of the Polymath Project
was still a scientific paper.
In fact, it was several papers. Right?
So unconventional means,
but conventional ends.
So there's a kind of
conservatism about it.
And don't get me wrong —
the Polymath Project is terrific,
but it is a pity that scientists
can only use tools
which have this kind of
conservative nature.

So let me tell you a story
about an instance
where we moved away
from this conservatism.
It's a rare story where
the conservatism has been broken.
It occurred in the 1990s,
when, as you know,
for the first time, biologists were taking
large amounts of genetic data
to collect in the Human Genome Project.
And there were sites online
which would allow biologists
to upload that data
so it could be shared
with other people around the world
and analyzed by other people.
Probably the best known of these
is the site GenBank,
which some of you may
have heard of or used.
And these sites, like GenBank,
had the problem in common with Qwiki
that scientists — they're not paid
or rewarded for sharing their data.
It's all about publishing papers.
So there was a considerable reluctance
to actually upload the data.
Yet, everybody could see
that this was silly —
it was obvious that this
was the right thing to do.
But just because it was obvious
didn't mean that people
were actually doing it.

So a meeting was convened
in Bermuda in 1996
of many of the world's leading
molecular biologists.
And they sat and they discussed
the problem for several days,
and they came up with what are now
called the Bermuda Principles,
which state that:
first, once human genetic data
is taken in the lab,
it should be immediately uploaded
to a site like GenBank;
and two, that the data
would be in the public domain.
And these principles were given teeth,
because they were taken by the big
scientific grant agencies —
the US National Institutes of Health,
the UK Wellcome Trust —
and actually baked into policy.
So it meant that if you were a scientist
who wanted to work on the human genome,
you had to agree to abide
by these principles.
And today, I'm very pleased
to say, as a result,
you can go online — anybody here —
and download the human genome.

So that's a terrific story.
But the human genome
is just a tiny, tiny fraction
of all scientific knowledge.
Even just in other parts of genetics,
there is so much knowledge
that is still locked up.
I spoke with one bioinformatician
who told me that he'd been "sitting
on the genome of an entire species
for more than a year."
An entire species.
And in other parts of science,
it is routine that scientists
hoard their data.
They hoard the computer code
that they write
that could be useful,
potentially, to other people.
They hoard their best ideas.
And they often hoard even
the descriptions of the problems
that they think are most interesting.
And so, what I and other people
in the Open Science movement
would like to do is,
we'd like to change this situation.
We would like to change
the culture of science
so that scientists become
much more strongly motivated
to share all of these
different kinds of knowledge.
We want to change the values
of individual scientists
so they start to see it
as part of their job
to be sharing their data,
to be sharing their code,
to be sharing their best ideas
and their problems.
So, if we can do this,
this kind of change in values,
then we will indeed start to see
individual scientists rewarded
for doing these things;
there will be incentives to do them.

It's a difficult thing to do, however.
We're talking about changing the culture
of entire large parts of science.
But it has happened
before once in history,
right back at the dawn of science.
Galileo, 1609: he points his telescope
up at the sky towards Saturn,
and he sees for the first time in history
what we now know are the rings of Saturn.
Does he tell everybody in the world?
No, he doesn't do that.
He writes down a description, privately,
and then he scrambles the letters
in the description into an anagram,
and he sends that anagram
to several of his astronomer rivals.

(Laughter)

And what this ensures is that,
if they later make the same discovery,
he can reveal the anagram
and get the credit,
but in the meantime, he hasn't given up
any knowledge at all.
And I'm sad to say that he was
not uncommon at the time:
Newton, Huygens, Hooke, Leonardo —
they all used similar devices.
OK?
The printing press had been around
for 150 years by this time.
And yet, there was a great battle
in the 17th and 18th centuries
to change the culture of science,
so that it became expected
that when a scientist made a discovery,
they would reveal it in a journal.

Now, that's great that that change
has happened. It's terrific.
But today, we have new technologies,
we have new opportunities
to share our knowledge in new ways
and the ability to create tools
that actually allow us
to solve problems in entirely new ways.
So we need to have a second
open science revolution.
It is my belief
that any publicly funded science
should be open science.

How can we achieve this change?
Well, if you're a scientist — and I know
many of you are not scientists,
but if you are a scientist,
then there are things that you can do.
You can get involved
in an open science project,
even if it's just for a small
fraction of your time.
You can find forums online
where you can share
your knowledge in new ways,
ways that allow other people
to build on that knowledge.
You can also, if you're more ambitious,
start an open science project of your own.
If you're really bold,
you may wish to experiment
with entirely new ways of collaborating,
in much the same way
as the Polymath Project did.
But above all, what you should do
is be very generous in giving credit
to those of your colleagues
who are practicing science in the open
and to promote their work.
It is only conservative scientific values
that look down on these activities —
the sharing of data, the blogging,
or using of wikis and so on.
You can reject those conservative values
and engage your scientific
colleagues in conversation
to promote the value
of these new ways of working,
to emphasize that it takes bravery
to do these things,
particularly by young scientists.
It's through such conversation that
the culture of science can be changed.

So if you are not a scientist,
there are also things that you can do.
My belief is that the single most
important thing that we can do
to give impetus to open science
is to create a general awareness
amongst the population
of the issue of open science
and of its critical importance.
If there is that general awareness,
then the scientific community
will inevitably find —
it will be dragged
by the population at large
in the right direction.
There are simple things you can do.
You can talk to your friends
and acquaintances who are scientists
and just ask them
what are they doing to work more openly.
Or you can use your imagination
and your personal power
to raise awareness in other ways.
We're talking about changing
not just what scientists do
but what grant agencies do,
what universities do
and what governments do.
And you can influence all of those things.

Our society faces a fundamental question:
What kinds of knowledge
are we going to expect
and incentivize our scientists to share?
Will we continue
as we have done in the past?
Or will we embrace new kinds of sharing,
which lead to new methods
for solving problems
and an acceleration
in the process of science,
entirely across the board?
My hope is that we will
embrace open science
and really seize
this opportunity that we have
to reinvent discovery itself.

Thank you. (Applause)
