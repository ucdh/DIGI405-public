Thanks very much.
I am Hannah Fry, the badass.
And today I'm asking the question:
Is life really that complex?
Now, I've only got nine minutes
to try and provide you with an answer,
so what I've done
is split this neatly into two parts:
part one: yes;
and later on, part two: no.
Or, to be more accurate: no?

(Laughter)

So first of all, let me try and define
what I mean by "complex."
Now, I could give you
a host of formal definitions,
but in the simplest terms,
any problem in complexity is something
that Einstein and his peers can't do.
So, let's imagine —
if the clicker works ... there we go.
Einstein is playing a game of snooker.
He's a clever chap, so he knows
that when he hits the cue ball,
he could write you an equation
and tell you exactly where the red ball
is going to hit the sides,
how fast it's going
and where it's going to end up.
Now, if you scale these snooker balls
up to the size of the solar system,
Einstein can still help you.
Sure, the physics changes,
but if you wanted to know about
the path of the Earth around the Sun,
Einstein could write you an equation
telling you where both objects are
at any point in time.
Now, with a surprising
increase in difficulty,
Einstein could include
the Moon in his calculations.
But as you add more and more planets,
Mars and Jupiter, say,
the problem gets too tough for Einstein
to solve with a pen and paper.
Now, strangely, if instead of having
a handful of planets,
you had millions of objects
or even billions,
the problem actually becomes much simpler,
and Einstein is back in the game.
Let me explain what I mean by this,
by scaling these objects back down
to a molecular level.

If you wanted to trace the erratic path
of an individual air molecule,
you'd have absolutely no hope.
But when you have millions
of air molecules all together,
they start to act in a way
which is quantifiable, predictable
and well-behaved.
And thank goodness air is well-behaved,
because if it wasn't,
planes would fall out of the sky.
Now, on an even bigger scale,
across the whole of the world,
the idea is exactly the same
with all of these air molecules.
It's true that you can't take
an individual rain droplet
and say where it's come from
or where it's going to end up.
But you can say with pretty good certainty
whether it will be cloudy tomorrow.
So that's it.
In Einstein's time,
this is how far science had got.
We could do really small problems
with a few objects
with simple interactions,
or we could do huge problems
with millions of objects
and simple interactions.
But what about everything in the middle?

Well, just seven years
before Einstein's death,
an American scientist called
Warren Weaver made exactly this point.
He said that scientific methodology
has gone from one extreme to another,
leaving out an untouched
great middle region.
Now, this middle region
is where complexity science lies,
and this is what I mean by complex.
Now, unfortunately, almost
every single problem you can think of
to do with human behavior
lies in this middle region.
Einstein's got absolutely no idea
how to model the movement of a crowd.
There are too many people
to look at them all individually
and too few to treat them as a gas.
Similarly, people are prone
to annoying things like decisions
and not wanting to walk into each other,
which makes the problem
all the more complicated.
Einstein also couldn't tell you
when the next stock market crash
is going to be.
Einstein couldn't tell you
how to improve unemployment.
Einstein can't even tell you
whether the next iPhone
is going to be a hit or a flop.
So to conclude part one:
we're completely screwed.
We've got no tools to deal with this,
and life is way too complex.

But maybe there's hope,
because in the last few years,
we've begun to see the beginnings
of a new area of science
using mathematics
to model our social systems.
And I'm not just talking here
about statistics and computer simulations.
I'm talking about writing down
equations about our society
that will help us understand
what's going on
in the same way as with the snooker balls
or the weather prediction.
And this has come about
because people have begun to realize
that we can use and exploit analogies
between our human systems
and those of the physical world around us.

Now, to give you an example:
the incredibly complex problem
of migration across Europe.
Actually, as it turns out, when you view
all of the people together,
collectively, they behave as though
they're following the laws of gravity.
But instead of planets
being attracted to one another,
it's people who are attracted
to areas with better job opportunities,
higher pay, better quality of life
and lower unemployment.
And in the same way as people
are more likely to go for opportunities
close to where they live already —
London to Kent, for example,
as opposed to London to Melbourne —
the gravitational effect of planets
far away is felt much less.

So, to give you another example:
in 2008, a group in UCLA
were looking into the patterns
of burglary hot spots in the city.
Now, one thing about burglaries
is this idea of repeat victimization.
So if you have a group of burglars
who manage to successfully rob an area,
they'll tend to return to that area
and carry on burgling it.
So they learn the layout of the houses,
the escape routes
and the local security measures
that are in place.
And this will continue to happen
until local residents and police
ramp up the security,
at which point, the burglars
will move off elsewhere.
And it's that balance
between burglars and security
which creates these dynamic
hot spots of the city.
As it turns out,
this is exactly the same process
as how a leopard gets its spots,
except in the leopard example,
it's not burglars and security,
it's the chemical process
that creates these patterns
and something called "morphogenesis."
We actually know an awful lot
about the morphogenesis of leopard spots.
Maybe we can use this to try and spot
some of the warning signs with burglaries
and perhaps, also to create
better crime strategies to prevent crime.
There's a group here at UCL
who are working with
the West Midlands police right now
on this very question.
I could give you
plenty of examples like this,
but I wanted to leave you
with one from my own research
on the London riots.

Now, you probably
don't need me to tell you
about the events of last summer,
where London and the UK saw
the worst sustained period
of violent looting and arson
for over twenty years.
It's understandable that, as a society,
we want to try and understand
exactly what caused these riots,
but also, perhaps, to equip our police
with better strategies
to lead to a swifter
resolution in the future.
Now, I don't want to upset
the sociologists here,
so I absolutely cannot talk about
the individual motivations for a rioter,
but when you look at
the rioters all together,
mathematically, you can separate it
into a three-stage process
and draw analogies accordingly.

So, step one: let's say
you've got a group of friends.
None of them are involved in the riots,
but one of them walks past
a Foot Locker which is being raided,
and goes in and bags himself
a new pair of trainers.
He texts one of his friends and says,
"Come on down to the riots."
So his friend joins him,
and then the two of them text
more of their friends, who join them,
and text more of their friends
and more and more, and so it continues.
This process is identical to the way
that a virus spreads through a population.
If you think about the bird flu epidemic
of a couple of years ago,
the more people that were infected,
the more people that got infected,
and the faster the virus spread
before the authorities managed
to get a handle on events.
And it's exactly the same process here.

So let's say you've got a rioter,
he's decided he's going to riot.
The next thing he has to do
is pick a riot site.
Now, what you should know
about rioters is that, um ...
Oops, clicker's gone. There we go.
What you should know about rioters is,
they're not prepared to travel
that far from where they live,
unless it's a really juicy riot site.

(Laughter)

So you can see that here from this graph,
with an awful lot of rioters
having traveled less than a kilometer
to the site that they went to.
Now, this pattern is seen
in consumer models of retail spending,
i.e., where we choose to go shopping.
So, of course, people like
to go to local shops,
but you'd be prepared
to go a little bit further
if it was a really good retail site.
And this analogy, actually, was already
picked up by some of the papers,
with some tabloid press calling the events
"Shopping with violence,"
which probably sums it up
in terms of our research.
Oh! — we're going backwards.

OK, step three.
Finally, the rioter is at his site,
and he wants to avoid
getting caught by the police.
The rioters will avoid
the police at all times,
but there is some safety in numbers.
And on the flip side, the police,
with their limited resources,
are trying to protect
as much of the city as possible,
arrest rioters wherever possible
and to create a deterrent effect.
And actually, as it turns out,
this mechanism between the two species,
so to speak, of rioters and police,
is identical to predators
and prey in the wild.
So if you can imagine rabbits and foxes,
rabbits are trying to avoid
foxes at all costs,
while foxes are patrolling the space,
trying to look for rabbits.
We actually know an awful lot
about the dynamics of predators and prey.
We also know a lot about
consumer spending flows.
And we know a lot about
how viruses spread through a population.

So if you take these three analogies
together and exploit them,
you can come up with a mathematical
model of what actually happened,
that's capable of replicating
the general patterns
of the riots themselves.
Now, once we've got this,
we can almost use this as a petri dish
and start having conversations
about which areas of the city
were more susceptible than others
and what police tactics could be used
if this were ever to happen
again in the future.
Even twenty years ago, modeling
of this sort was completely unheard of.
But I think that these analogies
are an incredibly important tool
in tackling problems with our society,
and perhaps, ultimately improving
our society overall.

So, to conclude: life is complex,
but perhaps understanding it need not
necessarily be that complicated.

Thank you.
