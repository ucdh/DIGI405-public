At 4pm, he answered his phone, but wouldn’t say where he was. At 4.09pm he answered again. He was in a car, heading to the city. He was no longer crying."

A UK survey carried out last year of families with children affected by ME/CFS revealed that 90 percent were concerned that professionals involved with their child did not believe them. One in five said a child protection referral had been made against them.
