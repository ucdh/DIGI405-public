When trains began to shuttle people 
across the coutryside,
many insisted 
they would never replace horses.
Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars,
telephones,
radio,
television,
and computers.
Each had their own host of detractors.
Even some experts 
insisted they wouldn’t catch on.

Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like
or what new inventions will populate it.
But time and time again,
we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present
will change the future.
And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives:
we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves.
Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change
in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.”
Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction
that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government,
or as he called it, “the end of history,”
their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products
at any given moment.

The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68.
They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits,
values,
and preferences,
along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before.
The other half described those features 
in their present selves,
and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future.
Based on these answers,
the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change
each participant reported or predicted.

For every age group in the sample,
they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes.
So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change
to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed.
Overwhelmingly, at all ages,
people’s future estimates of change 
came up short
compared to the changes 
their older counterparts recalled.
20-year-olds expected 
to still like the same foods at 30,
but 30-year-olds no longer 
had the same tastes.
30-year-olds predicted they’d still 
have the same best friend at 40,
but 40-year-olds 
had lost touch with theirs.
And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values
that 50-year-olds had reconsidered.
While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole,
they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much.
Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists:
we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us.

One consequence of this thinking
is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices
based on present preferences.
On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more
to see their current favorite musician 
ten years in the future
than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago.
While the stakes involved
in concert-going are low,
we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations
in more serious commitments,
like homes,
partners,
and jobs.
At the same time, 
there’s no real way to predict
what our preferences 
will be in the future.
Without the end of history Illusion,
it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans.

So the end of history illusion 
applies to our individual lives,
but what about the wider world?
Could we be assuming that how things 
are now is how they will continue to be?
If so, fortunately,
there are countless records
to remind us that the world does change,
sometimes for the better.
Our own historical moment 
isn’t the end of history,
and that can be just as much a source
of comfort as a cause for concern.
