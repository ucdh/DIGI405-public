As of 2018, there are around 
2.5 billion smartphone users in the world.
If we broke open all their newest phones,
which are just a fraction 
of the total that’ve been built,
and split them into their component parts,
that would produce 
around 85,000 kilograms of gold,
875,000 of silver,
and 40 million kilograms of copper.
How did this precious cache 
get into our phones,
and can we reclaim it?

Gold, silver, and copper 
are actually just a few
of the 70 or so chemical elements 
that make up the average smartphone.
These can be divided 
into different groups,
two of the most critical 
being rare earth elements
and precious metals.

Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements
that are actually common in Earth’s crust
and are found in many areas across 
the world in low concentrations.
These elements have a huge
range of magnetic,
phosphorescent,
and conductive properties
that make them crucial 
to modern technologies.
In fact, of the 17 types 
of rare earth metals,
phones and other electronics 
may contain up to 16.
In smartphones, these create the screen 
and color display,
aid conductivity,
and produce the signature vibrations,
amongst other things.

And yet, crucial as they are,
extracting these elements from the earth
is linked to some disturbing 
environmental impacts.
Rare earth elements can often be found,
but in many areas,
it’s not economically feasible 
to extract them due to low concentrations.
Much of the time,
extracting them requires 
a method called open pit mining
that exposes vast areas of land.
This form of mining destroys 
huge swaths of natural habitats,
and causes air and water pollution,
threatening the health 
of nearby communities.

Another group of ingredients 
in smartphones
comes with similar environmental risks:
these are metals such as copper,
silver,
palladium,
aluminum,
platinum,
tungsten,
tin,
lead,
and gold.
We also mine magnesium,
lithium,
silica,
and potassium to make phones,
and all of it is associated 
with vast habitat destruction,
as well as air and water pollution.
Mining comes with 
worrying social problems, too,
like large-scale human 
and animal displacement
to make way for industrial operations,
and frequently, 
poor working conditions for laborers.

Lastly, phone production 
also requires petroleum,
one of the main drivers of climate change.
That entwines our smartphones inextricably
with this growing planetary conundrum.

And, what’s more,
the ingredients we mine 
to make our phones aren’t infinite.
One day, they’ll simply run out,
and we haven’t yet discovered effective 
replacements for some.
Despite this,
the number of smartphones 
is on a steady increase;
by 2019 it’s predicted that 
there’ll be close to 3 billion in use.

This means that reclaiming the bounty 
within our phones
is swiftly becoming a necessity.
So, if you have an old phone,
you might want to consider your options 
before throwing it away.
To minimize waste, you could donate it 
to a charity for reuse,
take it to an e-waste recycling facility,
or look for a company 
that refurbishes old models.

However, even recycling companies 
need our scrutiny.
Just as the production of smartphones
comes with social 
and environmental problems,
dismantling them does too.
E-waste is sometimes intentionally 
exported to countries
where labor is cheap 
but working conditions are poor.
Vast workforces, 
often made up of women and children,
may be underpaid,
lack the training 
to safely disassemble phones,
and be exposed to elements 
like lead and mercury,
which can permanently damage 
their nervous systems.
Phone waste can also end up 
in huge dump sites,
leaching toxic chemicals 
into the soil and water,
mirroring the problems of the mines 
where the elements originated.

A phone is much more than it appears 
to be on the surface.
It’s an assemblage of elements
from multiple countries,
linked to impacts 
that are unfolding on a global scale.
So, until someone invents 
a completely sustainable smartphone,
we’ll need to come to terms
with how this technology
affects widespread places and people.
