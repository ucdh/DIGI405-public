A whip-like straw.
Powerful, crushing blades.
A pointed, piercing tube.
There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world,
but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts.
And that’s extremely useful to scientists
because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild,
they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats.

Scientific classification, or taxonomy,
is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels:
kingdom,
phylum,
class,
order,
family,
genus,
and species.
The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to,
while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on.

The chewing mouthpart is the most common.
It’s also the most primitive—
all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one
before evolving into something different.
It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles
with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods,
like leaves or other insects.
You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order,
grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order,
dragonflies of the Odonata order,
and beetles of the Coleoptera order.

The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak.
This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue
to suck up liquids like sap or blood.
It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes
that liquefy food for easier sucking.
Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts
and include bed bugs,
cicadas,
aphids,
and leafhoppers.

The siphoning mouthpart,
a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak,
also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis
that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers.
Insects of the Lepidoptera order—
butterflies and moths—
keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads
when they’re not feeding
and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar.

With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube,
this time ending in two spongy lobes
that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae.
The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva
and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action.
House flies,
fruit flies,
and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order
are the only insects 
that use this technique.
But, there’s a catch.
Biting flies within Diptera,
like mosquitoes,
horse flies,
and deer flies,
have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart.

And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles
and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip
for lapping up nectar.
On this type of mouthpart,
the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating.
For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order,
they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding.

Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules.
The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example,
have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions,
like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves
before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths
with siphoning mouthparts.

Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part,
help scientists—and you
—categorize insects.
So why not break out a magnifying lens
and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden,
biting your arm,
or just flying by your ear.
