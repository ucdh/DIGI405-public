At the annual Athenian 
drama festival in 426 BC,
a comic play called The Babylonians,
written by a young poet 
named Aristophanes,
was awarded first prize.
But the play’s depiction of Athens’ 
conduct during the Peloponnesian War
was so controversial that afterwards,
a politician named Kleon 
took Aristophanes to court
for "slandering the people of Athens 
in the presence of foreigners."
Aristophanes struck back two years later
with a play called The Knights.
In it, he openly mocked Kleon,
ending with Kleon’s character working as 
a lowly sausage seller
outside the city gates.
This style of satire was a consequence
of the unrestricted democracy 
of 5th century Athens
and is now called "Old Comedy."
Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest 
surviving comic dramas,
are stuffed full of parodies, songs, 
sexual jokes, and surreal fantasy.
They often use wild situations,
like a hero flying to heaven 
on a dung beetle,
or a net cast over a house to keep 
the owner’s father trapped inside,
in order to subvert audience expectations.
And they’ve shaped how comedy’s
been written and performed ever since.

The word "comedy" comes from 
the Ancient Greek "komos," – revel,
and "oide," – singing,
and it differed from its companion 
art form, "tragedy" in many ways.
Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt 
with the downfall of the high and mighty,
their comedies usually ended happily.
And where tragedy almost always 
borrowed stories from legend,
comedy addressed current events.
Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary
people and attacked the powerful.
His targets were arrogant politicians,
war-mongering generals,
and self-important intellectuals,
exactly the people who sat in 
the front row of the theatre,
where everyone could see their reactions.
As a result, they were referred to 
as komoidoumenoi:
"those made fun of in comedy."
Aristophanes’ vicious 
and often obscene mockery
held these leaders to account,
testing their commitment to the city.

One issue, in particular, 
inspired much of Aristophanes’ work:
the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta.
In Peace, written in 421 BC,
a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave,
where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians.
Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC,
Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata."
In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war
and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace.
Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations,
such as in "Clouds,"
where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking.
The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school,
where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right
and that a debt is not a debt.
No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end.

Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis,
a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly,
often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes.
For example, in "Birds,"
the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds
and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize,
they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city.
Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke,
as the play came in second.

By exploring new ideas
and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society,
Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens,
but he shaped the nature of comedy itself.
Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy,
his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere,
from slapstick
to double acts
to impersonations
to political satire.
Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes,
his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed.
And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC 
still resonates today:
“I’m a comedian, 
so I’ll speak about justice,
no matter how hard 
it sounds to your ears.”
