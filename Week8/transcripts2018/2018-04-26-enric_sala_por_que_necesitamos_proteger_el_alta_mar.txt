If you randomly jumped in
any point of the sea
today, surely you would see
something like this.
No big fishes, no fishes at all
because we have fished them
quicker than they reproduce.

Today, I want to propose a strategy
to save sea life
and the idea has a lot to do
with economics.
In 1999, there was a little place
called Cabo Pulmo
in Baja California, in Mexico
which was an underwater desert.
Fishermen were frustrated
by not having enough fishing.
So, they decided to do something
nobody expected.
Instead of spending more time at sea
searching for the last fish,
they decided to stop fishing completely.
They created a national park at sea,
a marine reserve.

When we came back to Cabo Pulmo
ten years later,
this is what we saw.
What had been an underwater wasteland
had become a kaleidoscope
of color and life.
We saw it come back to its pristine state
in just ten years
including the return
of the biggest predators
such as groupers, sharks,
horse mackerel...
Wow! It's an extraordinary place.

If you scuba dive, go to Cabo Pulmo.
Those visionary fishermen
are now earning more money
through tourism.

When we can align economic needs
with conservation
miracles can happen.
And we have seen similar recoveries
throughout the world.
I spent 20 years studying
human impact on the sea.
But seeing with my own eyes
the regeneration of places
like Cabo Pulmo gave me hope,
so I decided, ten years ago,
to abandon my position
as a university professor
to dedicate my life to protecting
more places at sea, like these.
In the past ten years
our National Geographic,
Pristine Seas team
have been exploring, studying, documenting
the wildest places at sea
and working with government
to protect them.
All these places are already protected,
and they cover a total surface
of the size of half Canada.
These places are the Yellowstones
and the Serengetis of the sea.
They are places where you
jump into the water
and immediately are surrounded by sharks.
And that's good, it's good!
Because sharks are a sign
of a healthy ecosystem.
These places are time machines
that show us the sea from 500 years ago,
from 1,000 years ago.
But they also show us
how the sea of the future could be.
Because the sea has
an extraordinary regenerative capacity.
We have seen incredible recoveries
in just a few years.
What we have to do is protect
more endangered places
so they can be wild
and full of life again.

So, the question is:
"Is there any way of accelerating
sea protection?"
Because today
just the 2 percent of the sea is protected
and that's not enough.
Studies suggest that we need to protect
at least 30 percent of the sea,
not just to save sea life,
but ourselves, too.
Because the sea gives us food,
and it gives us over the half
of the oxygen we breathe.
It absorbs much of the carbon pollution
we release into the atmosphere.
We need a healthy sea to survive.

So, is there a way to accelerate
protecting the sea?
I think there is.
And one of the solutions involves
looking at international waters.
Coastal countries have the authority
over 200 nautical miles from the coast.
Everything beyond that
is called international waters
or the high seas, too,
shown in dark blue on this map.
It's two-thirds of the ocean.
No country is in charge of the high seas,
but everyone is.
Since it's a bit like the wild west,
a lot of stuff happens there,
and nobody controls anything.

There are two kinds of fishing,
mainly, at the high seas:
at the bottom and at the surface.
Bottom trawling
is the most destructive practice
on the planet.
Supertrawlers, the biggest ships
on the sea,
have nets so large
they can hold a dozen 747 planes.
Those huge nets destroy
everything in their path
including deep-sea coral,
which lives in submarine mountains
and can be thousands of years old.
Surface fishing focuses mostly on species
that migrate from the high seas
to the coastal waters,
to the water of countries,
such as tunas and sharks.
Many of those are endangered species
because they have been fished too much.

But who fishes them?
Who fishes at the high seas?
Until now, it was difficult
to know it exactly.
Countries have not been transparent
concerning long-distance fishing.
Today, however, satellite technology
allows us to track ships individually.
And this is a revolution.
This is the first time we are presenting
the data you're about to see.
I'm going to show you
the routes of two ships fishing
throughout a year
using an automatic satellite
positioning system.
This is a ship fishing tunas and sharks
for months around the south coast
of the African continent.
A few months later,
the ship goes to Japan
to replenish supplies
and a while after, it's fishing
around Madagascar.
This other ship is a Russian trawler
that fishes cod in Russian waters
and also in international waters
in the North Atlantic.
Thanks to Global Fishing Watch
we have been able to track
more than 3,600 ships
from more than 20 countries
that were fishing at the high seas.
Global Fishing Watch uses
satellite positioning
and artificial intelligence
to automatically detect
whether a ship is fishing or navigating.
Depending on the kind of moves,
we also know what kind of fishing it is.

So, along with a group
of international colleagues,
scientists and economists,
we decided to investigate
who is fishing at the high seas
and who benefits from it.
My colleague Juan Mayorga
from the University of California
in Santa Barbara
has produced detailed maps
of fishing effort.
Effort means how much time and fuel
it takes to fish in each point of the sea.
We have maps for each country
that fishes in the high seas:
China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain
represent almost 80 percent
of the fishing effort in the high seas.
When we join all the countries,
this is what we get:
the global map of fishing effort.
We know the identity of each ship
on the database â€”
that's how we know
the length of the ship, the tonnage,
the engine power,
how many crew members are on board...
With this, we can calculate
the staff cost, the fuel cost, etc.
This is why, for the first time,
we were able to calculate
the costs of fishing on the high seas.
The darker the red, the higher the cost.

Colleagues from the University
of British Columbia
have illustrated how much
each country is fishing.
We also know the price of the fish
when it leaves the ship.
Combined with the effort data,
we have been able to calculate,
also for the first time,
the profit, the income
from fishing on the high seas.
We have cost and we have income,
thus, for the first time, too,
we were able to calculate
the profitability of fishing
on the high seas,
the net economic profit.

I'm going to show you another map.
The red color means
that we are losing money
by fishing in that area of the ocean.
The blue color means that fishing
is profitable there.
There it is.
It seems pretty profitable, right?
But there are two important factors
that we have to take into account.
The first is:
recent researches
have revealed the use of forced labor
or modern slavery on the high seas.
Companies use modern slavery
to reduce cost and get more profit.
Secondly:
each year, governments subsidize
fishing on the high seas
with over 4000 million dollars.

Let's go back to the profits map.
If we pretend that there is no slavery,
that people are paid minimum wage,
and deduct the government subsidies
from our calculation,
the map becomes this.
Half of fishing on the high seas
is not profitable.
In fact, subsidies
are four times bigger than the benefits.
What this economic analysis reveals
is that, practically,
the entirety of fishing
on the high seas makes no sense.
What country, what government
in its right mind
would subsidize and support
an industry cling to exploitation
and fundamentally destructive?
And it's not that profitable either.

So...
Why don't we close
all international waters to fishing?
Let's create a gigantic marine reserve
on the high seas.
Two thirds of the global ocean.
Studies from the University of California
suggest that such reserve
would help the species in the high seas
that migrate, such as tuna,
and part of that growth in abundance
would help to repopulate
the coastal waters of the countries
and the catch of those species
would also rise,
as well as the benefits,
because the cost of fishing would decrease
and the fish that large countries
are now fishing in the wild west
would be fished by the coastal countries.
And well, the ecological benefits
would be huge:
to provide a refuge of two-thirds
of the ocean
for species of predators,
such as tunas and sharks,
which are essential
to the health of the ecosystem.

So, protecting the high seas,
the international waters,
would have ecological, economic
and social benefits.
But, the truth is
that most fishing companies
don't care about the environment.
They would earn more money
if they didn't fish on the high seas.
Moreover, this would not affect
our ability to feed
our growing population,
because fishing on the high seas
represents only 5 percent
of global marine catch
since the high seas are not as productive
as the coastal waters.
And the high seas catch is sold
as high-standing products,
such as the tuna sashimi
and shark fin soup.
The high seas catch does not contribute
to global food security.

So, how are we going to do this?
How are we going to protect
the international waters?
Right now, negotiators
in the United Nations
are starting discussions for a new treaty
for the conservation
in international waters.
But this should not happen
at closed doors.
This is our big opportunity,
and we all must ensure that our countries
will support the conservation
of international waters.
There is a precedent.
In 2016, 24 countries
and the European Union
agreed to protect the Ross Sea,
the wildest place in the waters
surrounding Antarctica,
full of wildlife such as orcas,
leopard seals, penguins,
and those included fishing countries
like China, Russia, Spain and Japan,
but they decided that protecting
that unique place
was more beneficial than exploiting it
for little profit.
That is exactly the kind
of international cooperation we will need.
We can do it again.

If in 20 years our children
randomly jumped in any place of the sea,
what would they see?
An underwater desert,
like most of our ocean today,
or an abundance of life?
Our legacy for the future.
