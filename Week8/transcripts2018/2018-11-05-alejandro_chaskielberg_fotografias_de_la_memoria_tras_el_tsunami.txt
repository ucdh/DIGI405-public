Recently, my daughter and I decided 
to give away some toys she no longer used.
She's six years old, and asked me
for a camera to take a picture of them.
It was easier for her to farewell her toys
if she could take a picture 
before giving them away.
Because she doesn't want to forget them.
Because pictures help us remember.
We grab our cell phones to snap
when we feel something is special.
When something moves us,
we feel the urge to capture what we feel
and keep it in an image, in a picture.
However, we don't print photos
on paper like we used to do,
we share them in social networks,
or we upload them to the cloud.
Photography turned into something
intangible, something virtual.
But, what happens when we lose
or erase our digital photos?
Those in your computer, in that 
hard disk or in your phone.
Is there anybody here
who never lost a photo?
What would happen if, for some reason
we would lose all of our parents' photos
or other loved ones
who are no longer with us?
How are we to remember them?
Going back to our photos from the past
is like opening the doors to a dimension
where lots of memories
we seem to forget still remain.
And those images from the past,
those cherished treasures
can help us propel ourselves
into the future, as well.
I am a nighttime photographer.
I make portraits under moonlight,
in nature, close to the water.
I ask the people I photograph
to remain still and silent
for several minutes amidst darkness.
Meanwhile, I walk around them
to light them up
and light up the landscape with lanterns.
It's a moment of quietness and connection.
I went off to live in the islands
of the Paraná River Delta for two years.
I took with me an old camera
without knowing very well
where I was going,
neither what was I to find there.
And in time I came to know the islanders,
and I invited them to be photographed
under the full moon
to recreate their daily life routines
and jobs, but at night.
And I took photos of loggers,
hunters and dreamers.
People living in isolation, whose
only direct relationship is with water,
to the rhythm of the river highs and lows.
And that visual work in the Delta 
led me to travel around the world,
and took me to Japan.
I was searching for a new story to tell.
I wanted to work again with a community
which had some connection with water.
And it happened that the curator
of my exhibition, Ihiro Hayami,
had relatives in a small fisher town
and went with me for a visit.
Ōtsuchi is located between
the mountains and the sea.
It's a fifteen-thousand-people town
that in March 2011 went through
the worst tragedy in its history.
It was washed off by a tsunami
with waves tall as a five-story building.
Even though the alarms went off
many people didn't believe it would be
so strong, and remain in their homes.
As a consequence many people died,
close to a 10 percent of the population.
And 70 percent of houses were washed away.
This is why every local in Ōtsuchi 
has either friends or family
who died in the tsunami.
The power of the waves pulled the houses
off their base and the sea gulped them up.
Survivors were left with no shelter
and had to endure a winter with
temperatures below zero Celsius.
Amidst this chaos and total destruction
many people were trying to save
their family photos.
An officer of Japan's Self Defense Forces
recovers a photo album inside
a house in total ruin.
There it was the picture of a child.
The officer holds the album
as if he were holding the child.
I traveled to Ōtsuchi with my daughter
who was five month old at the time.
And the contrast of a baby
in the middle of such desolation
was impressive.
People would take her off of my arms
in order to kiss her.
And I'd wonder how to tell this story
that happened a year and a half ago.
What could be positive out of
such level of destruction.
The first thing I found were
big piles of rubble
made of all kind of things.
Twisted objects that speak about
life as it used to be in Ōtsuchi.
Like this vending machine
or this fishing elements,
car remains ...
or what's left of a house.
A lamp turned into a Moebius strip,
the symbol of infinite time.
As a contrast to these mountains of rubble
there was this town flattened by water.
The skeletons of the houses,
marked on the ground
were empty spaces, filled with stories.
So I invited the survivors
to go back to those spaces
where their houses or
workplaces used to exist.
And many accepted, but in general,
the kids didn't want to.
I photographed them during the night
as they remained silent and still
during the ten minutes each photo took.
The scenes were so sad, nothing had color.
She is Haruko Okano, a librarian,
and she's sitting on the remains of
Ōtsuchi's Library, where she worked.
This is the Second Volunteers
Firefighters Squad of Ōtsuchi
inside of what was the fire station.
The fireman standing up was in charge
of closing the anti-tsunami gates.
This is Yoshihiro Ogayu,
monk of Kogan-ji temple.
The temple was a refuge in case of tsunami
but even so it was destroyed.
His dad and his son died there.
When that first trip to Ōtsuchi was over
I found a photo album
in the middle of the street.
It had laid there for a year and a half
without having anyone pick it up.
It was all wet, heavy and it stank 
just like a dead animal.
It was tainted with color bubbles
gushing from the photos
that blended together.
I took a picture of it without giving it
much of a thought and I came back.
Once in Buenos Aires,
the Ōtsuchi experience
felt much like a far away dream.
It filled me up with doubt:
Why did I have to tell this story,
if I came from the other end of the world?
What did it had to do with me?
Why had I photographed the survivors
in black and white
if the reference of my work is color?
And while I made myself these questions,
my own life began to crumble.
Soon after breakup, my daughter's mother
went off to live in another country.
So I took on myself Lara's upbringing,
she was a one-year-old baby.
Project Ōtsuchi was put on hold,
because now it was me the one 
who had to survive and reinvent myself.
And some months later, revisiting the work
the family photo album image
popped up again.
But in this second view
I grasped it in a different way.
I thought I saw a painter's palette.
So I took the main colors of that album
to create my own color palette.
And I used those colors created
by the force of the tsunami
to color the images of the survivors.
And little by little, all the gray scenes
turned into something colorful.
I used color as a bridge to connect
the present and the past,
as the hub between their photos and mine.
Now I was feeling connected
with Ōtsuchi once again.
Two years passed since
until I was able to return to Japan

to search for other recovered photos
and find new colors to paint with.
There I met Mikio Komukai,
a nice man who had this NGO
that was recovering family photos
to send them back to their owners.
And with his help and the permission
of Ōtsuchi's government
I gained access to that impressive archive
of thousand of destroyed photos.
Contemplating those pictures 
I realized the intangible damage
the people of Ōtsuchi were facing;
the damage to their memory and identity.
Those blurred images 
were the measure of their loss.
The firefighters of Ōtsuchi.
I traveled a total of six times to finish
the project and publish a book.
And this is the last picture I took
with my two assistants, 
Mayumi Suzuki and Kazuhiko Chikaoka,
who both lost their parents to the tsunami.
We built an arch with plastic tubes
which they arranged in different positions
over the remains of this house.
And if you look carefully at the photo
you will see that their hands 
are holding this house of light.
In 2016 the government of Ōtsuchi
invited me to show my project,
but I had a feeling that it was not over.
There was something left to do.
So I suggested that we put together
a collective exhibition
which we set up in the gymnasium
of a temporary school.
And we invited high school students
and the people in town to take photos.
Now the kids did want to join in.
We gave them disposable cameras
with one assignment:
to tell their lives in pictures,
their intimate whereabouts.
Five years away from the tsunami
there were children back in the streets
taking photos, recording its life.
And together, in community,
we created a small photo archive
of what Ōtsuchi is today.
The people in town took pictures
to create new memories:
The memories of the future of Ōtsuchi.
As for me, I started my own photo album
telling my life and my travels with Lara.
And here we are in Japan,
saying goodbye to the sea of Ōtsuchi.
Thank you very much.
