A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse,
rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter
and the scholar she takes as her lover.
To get some time alone together,
the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks
that involve feigning madness,
staging a biblical flood,
and exposing themselves in public.
But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife,
and comes by every night 
to sing outside her house.
This becomes so tiresome 
that she tries to scare him away
by hanging her rear end out the window 
for him to kiss.
When this appears not to work,
her scholar decides 
to try farting in the same position,
but this time, the clerk 
is waiting with a red-hot poker.

This might all sound like a bawdy joke,
but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created:
The Canterbury Tales,
which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly.
The work consists of 24 stories,
each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters.
Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures
such as a Knight,
a Clerk,
and a Nun,
and the less recognizable Reeve,
and Mancible,
and others.

The Tales are written in Middle English,
which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today.
It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries,
and evolved from Old English
due to increased contact 
with European romantic languages
after the Norman Conquest of 1066.
Most of the Middle English alphabet 
is still familiar today,
with the inclusion 
of a few archaic symbols,
such as yogh, which denotes the y,
j,
or gh sound.

The loquacious cast of the Tales 
first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark.
They have a journey in common:
a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett,
a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral.
Eager and nosy
for some personal details,
the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition:
whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner.

If not for their pilgrimage,
many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact.
This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system
that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes,
made up of peasants and serfs.
By Chaucer’s time,
a professional class of merchants 
and intellectuals had also emerged.

Chaucer spent most of his life 
as a government official
during the Hundred Years' War,
traveling throughout Italy and France,
as well as his native England.
This may have influenced
the panoramic vision of his work,
and in the Tales,
no level of society is above mockery.

Chaucer uses the quirks 
of the characters’ language –
the ribald humor of the Cook,
the solemn prose of the Parson,
and the lofty notions of the Squire –
to satirize their worldviews.
The varied dialects, genres, 
and literary tropes
also make the work a vivid record
of the different ways Medieval audiences 
entertained themselves.
For instance, the Knight’s tale 
of courtly love,
chivalry,
and destiny
riffs on romance,
while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies
filled with scatological language,
sexual deviance,
and slapstick.

This variation 
includes something for everyone,
and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work
in both Middle English and translation.
While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines,
it's apparently unfinished,
as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims
and promises four stories apiece,
and the innkeeper never crowns a victor.
It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations
that he delayed picking a winner -
or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character
that he just couldn’t choose.
Whatever the reason,
this means that every reader
is free to judge;
the question of who wins is up to you.
