By the light of the moon,
a group of youths sneak into the woods,
where they take mind-altering substances,
switch it up romantically,

and brush up against creatures 
from another dimension.
"A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream" sees 
Shakespeare get psychedelic –
and the result is a treat in the 
theatre and on the page.

First performed in the 1590's,
this play is one of Shakespeare’s 
friskiest works,
filled with trickery, madness and magic.
Set over the course of one night,
Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace.
The plot is structured around patterns of 
collision and dissolution,
where characters from different worlds 
are thrown together and torn apart.
Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock 
the characters’ self-obsession
and question authority with a comic twist.

The action is set in Ancient Greece,
but like many of Shakespeare’s plays 
it reflects his contemporary concerns.
The magical setting of the woods at night
disrupts the boundaries between 
separate groups, with bizarre results.
Here, the bard plays with the rigid class 
system of his own time,
taking three distinct groups
and turning their society upside-down
in a world where no mortal is in control.

The play opens with young Hermia
raging at her father Egeus and 
Theseus, the King of Athens,
who have forbidden her to marry 
her lover Lysander.
Hermia has no interest in her father's 
choice for her of Demetrius –
but her best friend Helena 
definitely does.
Furious at their elders, Hermia and 
Lysander elope under cover of darkness,
with Demetrius in hot pursuit.
This is further complicated 
by Helena’s decision
to follow them all into the woods,
in the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart.

At this point, the woods are 
getting crowded,
as the lovers are sharing the space 
with a group of “rude mechanicals”—
a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing 
a play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom.
Unbeknownst to them, the humans have 
entered into the world of the fairies.

Despite their magical splendor, 
Oberon and Titania,
the king and queen of the fairies, 
have their own romantic problems.
Furious at his inability to control 
Titania, the jealous Oberon
commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the
juice of a magical flower over her eyes.
When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love 
with the first thing she sees.
On his mission,
Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over
the eyes of the napping Demetrius
and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head
into that of a donkey for good measure.

As eyes flicker open,
a night of chaos commences that includes
broken hearts, mistaken identity,
and transformations.
Out of all the characters, Bottom probably
fares the best –
when the bewitched Titania 
lays eyes on him,
she calls on her fairies to lavish him 
with wine and treasures
and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman 
off his feet:
“pluck the wings from painted butterflies/
To fan the moonbeams 
from his sleeping eyes.
Nod to him, elves, 
and do him courtesies.”

While magic is the catalyst to the action,
the play reflects the real drama 
of the things we do for love –
and the nonsensical behavior 
of the people under its spell.
The moon overlooks the action 
“like a silver bow,”
signifying erratic behavior, 
the dark side of love,
and the bewitching allure of a world 
where the usual rules don’t apply.

Although the characters eventually 
come to their senses,
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" 
raises the question
of how much agency we have 
over our own daily lives.
But it’s not the more realistically
rendered lovers, rulers or workers
who have the last word,
but the impish Puck who queries whether we
can ever truly trust what we see:

If we shadows have offended,
Think but this and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear. 

And in so doing,
he evokes the effect of entering into the 
magical world of great theatre
that plays with the boundary between 
illusion and reality –
and dramatizes the possibility 
that life is but a dream.
