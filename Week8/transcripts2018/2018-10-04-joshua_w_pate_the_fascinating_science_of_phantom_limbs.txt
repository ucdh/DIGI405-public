The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it—
not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail.
They can flex their phantom fingers
and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband
or the throb of an ingrown toenail.
And astonishingly enough,
occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom.

So what causes phantom limb sensations?
The accuracy of these apparitions
suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains.
And the fact that it’s possible
for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one
implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map.
But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation
apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors:
the vast majority of them are painful.
To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain,
we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain.

Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything
from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips
to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space.
Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord
and up to the brain.
Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself,
most of it remains 
behind after an amputation.
But the loss of a limb
alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway.

At the site of an amputation,
severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive,
transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure.
Under normal circumstances,
these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation,
there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn,
and signals can intensify.

Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain.
There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them.
The entire body is mapped in this cortex.
Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings,
like the lips and hands,
are represented by the largest areas.
The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body
with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex,
The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink
based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part.
For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists
than in non-violinists.
The brain also increases 
cortical representation
when a body part is injured
in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger.
This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain.
The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible
for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there,
because they still 
have representation in the brain.
Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it.

But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own.
Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires
a combination of physical therapy,
medications for pain management,
prosthetics,
and time.
A technique called mirror box therapy
can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion
and reducing pain in the phantom limb.
The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror
and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror.
This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom
rather than just feeling it.
Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments
that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike.
Prosthetics can also 
create a similar effect—
many patients report pain
primarily when they remove 
their prosthetics at night.
And phantom limbs may in turn
help patients conceptualize
prosthetics as extensions of their bodies
and manipulate them intuitively.

There are still many questions 
about phantom limbs.
We don’t know why some amputees
escape the pain
typically associated 
with these apparitions,
or why some don’t have phantoms at all.
And further research into phantom limbs
isn’t just applicable to the people 
who experience them.
A deeper understanding 
of these apparitions
will give us insight into the work
our brains do every day
to build the world as we perceive it.
They’re an important reminder
that the realities we experience are,
in fact, subjective.
