Hi, my name is I am
the one that tangles up
consonants and vowels.

I am international.

Hello, how are you?

I love people.

I think it's great
we're all hugging here,
as we mix our vowels,
and we make the saddle.

I appreciate less the consonants
of those we haven't sounded.

I'm pressing the buzzer;
I am interpassionate.

OK.
Before leaving you guys
with more talks
with better English than mine —

(Laughter)

I would like to see you dance.

(Laughter)

And especially a section of your body ...
your hips.

(Laughter)

Alright?
OK, you know your pelvis
is the center of your body
and this is the intersection
that makes you really strong, alright?

(Laughter)

OK, so it's super easy.
We're going to roll our hips together, OK?
So please stand up.

(Laughter)

It's really easy.
You're just going to have
to roll your hips like that.

The weekend in Rome,
I have to roll my hips.

While I'm eating an apple,
I have to roll my hips.

Whenever I see a man,
I have to roll my hips.
roll my hips, roll my hips.
roll my hips, roll my hips.
