You’re overseeing the delivery 
of crucial supplies to a rebel base
deep in the heart of enemy territory.
To get past Imperial customs, all
packages must follow a strict protocol:
if a box is marked with 
an even number on the bottom,
it must be sealed with a red top.

The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport
when you receive an urgent message.
One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly,
but they lost track of which one.
All the boxes are still 
on the conveyor belt.
Two are facing down: 
one marked with a four,
and one with a seven.
The other two are facing up:
one with a black top,
another with a red one.

You know that any violation 
of the protocol
will get the entire shipment confiscated
and put your allies in grave danger.
But any boxes you pull off for inspection
won’t make it onto this delivery run,
depriving the rebels 
of critically needed supplies.
The transport leaves in a few moments,
with or without its cargo.
Which box or boxes should you 
grab off the conveyor belt?

It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes
to see what’s on the other side of each.
But in fact, only two of them matter.

Let’s look at the protocol again.
All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top.
It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes,
so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven.
What about the box with a red top?
Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even?
As it turns out, we don’t.
The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number,
then it should have a red top.
It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops,
or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number.
The requirement 
only goes in one direction.
So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid.
We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid,
to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box.

If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match
between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone.
That error is so common,
we even have a name for it:
affirming the consequent,
or the fallacy of the converse.
This fallacy wrongly assumes
that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result,
it must also be sufficient for it.
For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition
for being a habitable planet.
But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition –
planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability.

If that still seems hard 
to wrap your head around,
let’s look at 
a slightly different problem.
Imagine the boxes contain groceries.
You see one marked for shipment 
to a steakhouse
and one to a vegetarian restaurant.
Then you see two more boxes 
turned upside down:
one labeled as containing meat,
and another as containing onions.
Which ones do you need to check?
Well, it’s easy –
make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant,
and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat.
The onions can go to either place,
and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product.

Why does this scenario seem easier?
Formally, it’s the same problem –
two possible conditions
for the top of the box,
and two for the bottom.
But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs,
and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables,
they’re not the only ones who do so.
In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary,
and when they’re abstracted that way,
the logical connections 
become harder to see.

In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through
to enable the resistance 
to fight another day.
And you did it by thinking 
outside the box –
both sides of it.
