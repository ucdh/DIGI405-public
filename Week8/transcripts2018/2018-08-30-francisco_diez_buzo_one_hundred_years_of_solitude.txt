One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco
for a vacation with his family,
Colombian journalist Gabriel García 
Márquez abruptly turned his car around,
asked his wife to take care of the
family’s finances for the coming months,
and returned home.
The beginning of a new book 
had suddenly come to him:
“Many years later, 
as he faced the firing squad,
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember 
that distant afternoon
when his father took him to discover ice.”

Over the next eighteen months,
those words would blossom 
into One Hundred Years of Solitude.
A novel that would go on 
to bring Latin American literature
to the forefront 
of the global imagination,
earning García Márquez 
the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature.

What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude 
so remarkable?
The novel chronicles the fortunes
and misfortunes
of the Buendía family 
over seven generations.
With its lush, detailed sentences,
large cast of characters,
and tangled narrative,
One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is not an easy book to read.
But it’s a deeply rewarding one,
with an epic assortment 
of intense romances,
civil war,
political intrigue,
globe-trotting adventurers,
and more characters 
named Aureliano than you’d think possible.

Yet this is no mere historical drama.
One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is one of the most famous examples
of a literary genre 
known as magical realism.
Here, supernatural events or abilities
are described in a realistic 
and matter-of-fact tone,
while the real events of human life 
and history
reveal themselves 
to be full of fantastical absurdity.
Surreal phenomena within the
fictional village of Macondo
intertwine seamlessly with events taking
place in the real country of Colombia.
The settlement begins 
in a mythical state of isolation,
but is gradually exposed 
to the outside world,
facing multiple calamities along the way.
As years pass, 
characters grow old and die,
only to return as ghosts,
or to be seemingly reincarnated 
in the next generation.
When the American fruit company 
comes to town,
so does a romantic mechanic who is
always followed by yellow butterflies.
A young woman up and floats away.

Although the novel moves forward 
through subsequent generations,
time moves in an almost cyclical manner.
Many characters have similar names 
and features to their forebears,
whose mistakes they often repeat.
Strange prophecies 
and visits from mysterious gypsies
give way to the skirmishes 
and firing squads of repeated civil wars.
An American fruit company opens 
a plantation near the village
and ends up massacring thousands 
of striking workers,
mirroring the real-life 
‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928.
Combined with the novel’s magical realism,
this produces a sense 
of history as a downward spiral
the characters seem powerless to escape.
Beneath the magic is a story 
about the pattern of Colombian
and Latin American history 
from colonial times onward.

This is a history that 
the author experienced firsthand.
Gabriel García Márquez grew up
in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict
between its Conservative 
and Liberal political parties.
He also lived in an autocratic Mexico
and covered the 1958 Venezuelan 
coup d’état as a journalist.
But perhaps his biggest influences 
were his maternal grandparents.
Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a
decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War
whose accounts of the rebellion against
Colombia's conservative government
led Gabriel García Márquez 
to a socialist outlook.
Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’
omnipresent superstition
became the foundation 
of One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style.
Their small house in Aracataca 
where the author spent his childhood
formed the main inspiration for Macondo.

With One Hundred Years of Solitude,
Gabriel García Márquez 
found a unique way
to capture the unique history 
of Latin America.
He was able to depict the strange reality 
of living in a post-colonial society,
forced to relive 
the tragedies of the past.

In spite of all this fatalism,
the novel still holds hope.
At his Nobel Lecture,
García Marquez reflected 
on Latin America’s long history
of civil strife and rampant iniquity.
Yet he ended the speech by affirming the
possibility of building a better world,
to quote, “where no one will be able
to decide for others how they die,
where love will prove true
and happiness be possible,
and where the races condemned 
to one hundred years of solitude
will have, at last and forever,
a second chance on earth."
