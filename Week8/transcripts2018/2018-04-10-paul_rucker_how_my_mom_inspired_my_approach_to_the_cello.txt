On the flight here,
I was reminded about my mom.
I'm a self-taught cellist,
I've never had a lesson.
I studied double bass, but I just
picked up the cello and started playing
because I love doing it.
But my mom was an inspiration to me.
I did not realize she was an inspiration,
because she got her music degree
through a mail-order course,
the US School of Music.
While raising two kids,
she received a lesson a week in the mail,
and practiced.
And at the end of a couple of years,
she put on a recital.
And I'll be 50 this month,
and it took me that long to realize
that she was that big of an inspiration.
I'm just going to keep â€”
yeah, thanks, mom.

(Applause)

She's also one of the most
extraordinary people I know,
beyond being a wonderful musician.
I want to play a little bit for mom
and your moms as well, actually.

You know, when you normally
hear a cello, you think of this.

We're not going to do that today.
