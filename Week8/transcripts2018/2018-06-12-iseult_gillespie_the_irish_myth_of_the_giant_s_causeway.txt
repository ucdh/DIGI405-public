On the coast of Northern Ireland,
a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns
called the Giant’s Causeway
stretches into the ocean.
The scientific explanation for this
is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing
as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption.
But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting.

According to legend,
the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast
with his wife Oonagh.
Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats
of the giant Benandonner,
or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland.
The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other
in dramatic shows of strength.

Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival,
but it fell short of reaching land.
Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man,
and the crater left from the disturbed
earth filled with water
to become Lough Neagh.
The giants’ tough talk continued,
until one day Benandonner challenged 
Finn to a fight, face to face.
And so the Irish giant tossed 
enough boulders into the sea
to create a bridge of stepping 
stones to the Scottish coast.

Finn marched across in a fit of rage.
When Scotland loomed before him,
he made out the figure 
of Benandonner from afar.
Finn was a substantial size,
but at the sight of his colossal
enemy thundering towards him,
his courage faltered.
With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck
and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran.

Back home, with Benandonner 
fast approaching,
Finn trembled as he described 
his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh.
They knew that if he faced 
Benandonner head on,
he’d be crushed.
And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan -
they needed to create an illusion of size,
to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight.

As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge,
Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle.
Disguised as an enormous baby,
Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door.
The house shook as he stepped inside.

Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home,
but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited.
When Benandonner tore into the cakes 
placed before him,
he cried out in pain
for he’d shattered his teeth 
on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside.
She told him that this 
was Finn’s favorite bread,
sowing a seed of doubt 
in Benandonner’s mind
that he was any match for his rival.

When Finn let out a squawk,
Benandonner’s attention was drawn 
to the gigantic baby in the corner.
So hefty was the infant swaddled 
under piles of blankets,
Benandonner shuddered at the thought 
of what the father would look like.
He decided he’d rather not find out.

As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks 
connecting the shores,
breaking up the causeway.
What remains are two identical 
rock formations:
one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland
and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, 
right across the sea.
