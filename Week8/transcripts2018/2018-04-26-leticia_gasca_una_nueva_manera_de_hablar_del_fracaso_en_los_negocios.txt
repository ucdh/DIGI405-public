If we were to travel to the past,
to the year 800 BCE,
we would see that the Greeks, by law,
forced failed businesspeople
to sit in the marketplace
with a basket on their heads,
so that everyone had a clear idea
as to the state of their business.
In premodern Italy,
owners of failed businesses
that had outstanding debts
were taken, completely nude,
to the public plaza,
where they had to hit
their backside against a rock
while a crowd jeered at them.
In 17th-century France,
failed business owners were carried
to the center of the marketplace,
where the beginning of their bankruptcy
was announced publicly.
To avoid being immediately taken to jail,
they had to wear a green beret
so everyone knew they were a failure.
Of course, these are extreme cases,
but it's important to refer to the past
to remember that when the laws
are too punishing to failed entrepreneurs,
it disincentivizes the creation
of new businesses and innovation,
which are the engines
of economic growth of any country.

Fortunately, time has passed,
and now we don't publicly humiliate
entrepreneurs who fail.
Still, it's not common
to see big business figures publish
the details of their mistakes
on social media.
I think everyone here can relate
to the pain you feel when a project fails.
But that doesn't mean
we share the details of those experiences
with our friends.
And I understand perfectly —
I've been there, too.
I had a business that failed horribly.
It was a very painful experience
and sharing it was very difficult.
In fact, sharing it took seven years,
a good amount of vulnerability
and the company of my friends.
This is the story of my failure.

When I was at college studying business,
I met a group of indigenous women
who lived in a very marginalized
rural community in Puebla,
a state in the center of Mexico.
They created beautiful handmade crafts.
So when I met them
and became familiar with their work,
I decided that I wanted to do
something to help them.
And I did everything
just like they had taught me
at business school back then:
I partnered with my friends;
we procured funding;
we spent a lot of time
building the business
and training the artisans.

But we soon realized that we were rookies.
The truth is, the crafts didn't sell —
or better yet, we didn't know
how to sell them —
and the business plan we had made
wasn't realistic.
We worked for years without salary,
waiting for a miracle to happen,
hoping that magically,
a huge buyer would appear
and make the business profitable
and prevent the entire project from dying.
But in the end, the miracle didn't happen.
We had to close the business
and that broke my heart,
because I began the whole project
in order to have a positive impact
on the life of the artisans,
and I felt that I had actually had
a very negative impact.
I felt so guilty about what happened
that for years I hid it from my résumé
and from my conversations.

Some time later, I was out
with some entrepreneur friends,
and the topic of failure came up.
I took the risk and confessed to them
the story of my failed business
that I had kept a secret
for so many years.
To my surprise, my friends
had similar stories.
And at that moment, something became
very clear in my mind:
I hung out with total failures!

(Laughter)

No, but seriously,
that day I realized
that we all have hidden failures.
Tell me if that's not true.

(Audience responds)

That night, I realized
that sharing your failures publicly
makes you stronger, not weaker.
Actually, for me, it was like an exorcism.
It was like a weight was lifted off of me;
I had nothing to hide anymore.
That night, I also realized
that being open to this new place
of my vulnerability
helped me connect with others
in a much deeper and authentic way.
As a result of that experience,
of sharing stories of businesses
that didn't work,
we decided to create an event series
so that other people
could also share their stories
of failed businesses.
We called it "FuckUp Nights."
And some time later, we created
the Failure Institute —

(Laughter)

the name is awesome —
the Failure Institute.
It's a research center
dedicated to the study of failure
and its consequences on people,
businesses and society.
It's been really surprising and gratifying
to find that when an entrepreneur
gets up on stage
to tell the story
of their failed business,
it's not a cause for humiliation or shame,
as it usually was in the past.
Actually, it's an opportunity
to share lessons
and generate empathy.
We've also found that when members
of the same team get together
to share their stories of failure,
something magical happens:
collaboration becomes easier,
and the bonds become stronger.

In fact, over the course of
the events and the research,
we've found surprising things.
Perhaps among my favorites
are the differences between men and women
when they're faced with failure.
The most common behavior among men
after closing their business
is to open another business
but in a different sector
within a year,
while among women, it's more common
to look for a job
and postpone creating
a new business for the future.
Our hypothesis is that
this can be attributed to
women's tendency to suffer more
from impostor syndrome;
that is, we feel like
we're lacking in some way
in order to be true entrepreneurs.
However, I've seen that many times,
we have everything necessary,
and all that's missing
is that we risk taking the first step.
And in the case of men,
it's more common that they feel
they have the necessary knowledge
and they just need to apply it
in another place
where they'd have more luck.

We've also found that there are
interesting regional differences
in terms of the way in which
entrepreneurs recuperate
after the failure of our business.
For example, on the European continent,
it's much more common
that entrepreneurs seek out a therapist
to recuperate emotionally.
On the other hand,
on the American continent,
the most common behavior
is to seek out education and training.

Another finding that's really
changed my life
is the profound impact that
public policy has
on the way in which entrepreneurs
decide to close their business
and recuperate from the experience.
For example, in my country, Mexico,
the regulatory framework
for closing a business is so strict
that closing a business
in compliance with the law
can take too much time and too much money.
Let's start with the money part.
If things go well, if your business
isn't involved in big problems,
if you don't have any issues
with suppliers like outstanding debts,
closing a business
will cost you US $2,000.
which in my country
is a considerable amount of money.
Someone who earns
the minimum salary as of 2018
would have to work 15 months
to come up with that money.
And with respect to time, on average,
closing a business takes two years.
As we know, in Mexico
and in many other places in the world,
the average life expectancy of a business
is two years.
So what happens when
the life expectancy of a business
is so similar to the amount of time
it will take you to close it
if it doesn't work?
Of course, this disincentivizes
the creation of new businesses
and promotes the informal economy.
In fact, econometric research has shown
that the less time and money needed
to close a business,
the greater the creation of new business.

So in 2017, we decided to present
a series of public policy recommendations
for the law that governs
the closing of businesses.
For a year, we worked with
the Association of Entrepreneurs
and with the Mexican congress,
and the good news is
that we managed to change the law.

(Applause)

The idea is that once
the new legislation goes into effect,
entrepreneurs will be able
to close their business
via an online process, which will be
much more accessible to everyone
and shorter.
The truth is, when I look back
and remember that night
when my friends and I confessed
our failures to each other
six years ago,
I'm surprised,
because at that moment,
our intention was very simple:
the only thing we wanted to do was put
the subject of failure on the table
so more friends could see
that this was a topic to be talked about.
It's not a time for humiliation
as in the past,
nor is it a cause for celebration,
as some people say.

In fact, I'll admit that when I hear
students or people from Silicon Valley
brag about failing fast or frequently,
as if closing a business were no big deal,
the truth is, it worries me a lot.
And it worries me because I think
that behind the mantra of failing fast,
or "fail fast" as they say
in Silicon Valley,
there's a dark side.
On one hand, when we insist
to entrepreneurs
that failing fast is the only option,
it's possible that
we're promoting mediocrity —
that entrepreneurs
don't give their maximum effort,
and that they give up when faced
with the most minor difficulty.
I also think that when we talk
about failing fast,
we're minimizing that negative impact
that closing a business has.
Of course, I believe failing fast
is a great way to accelerate learning
and avoid wasting time.
But we can't deny
the negative consequences
that exist behind the death of a business.

For example, when
my social enterprise failed,
the worst part was going back
to the indigenous community
and confessing to the artisans
that the project had died,
and that I was responsible.
For many, this could have been viewed
as a learning opportunity.
The truth is that the death
of this business
meant that the artisans would lose income
that they desperately needed.

So today, I'd like to propose an idea.
I'd like to propose
that just as we put aside
the idea of publicly humiliating
entrepreneurs who fail,
we should also put aside the idea
that to fail fast is always best.
Instead, I want to propose a new mantra:
fail with awareness,
or "fail mindfully" —
experience with full attention
the entire process that closing
a business involves.
Remember that businesses are not entities
that magically appear and disappear.
Businesses are made up of people.
And if a business project fails,
surely, some of those people
will lose their jobs
or lose money.
And in the case of social enterprises
or green businesses,
when they fail,
surely the closing of the project
will have a negative impact
on the communities or ecosystems
they were intended to benefit.

But what do I mean by "fail mindfully"?
For me, it means being aware of the impact
that closing a business has,
being aware of the lessons learned,
and above all, being aware
of the great responsibility
to share those lessons with the world.

Thank you.
