“Here lies Arthur, 
king who was, and king who will be.”

So reads the inscription 
on King Arthur’s gravestone
in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur.
Writing in the 15th century,
Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic
this inscription would turn out to be.
King Arthur has risen again 
and again in our collective imagination,
along with his retinue of knights,
Guinevere,
the Round Table,
Camelot,
and of course, Excalibur.
But where do these stories come from,
and is there any truth to them?

King Arthur as we know him 
is a creation of the later Middle Ages,
but his legend actually has its roots 
in Celtic poetry from an earlier time:
the Saxon invasions of Britain.
After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE,
Saxon invaders from 
what’s now Germany and Denmark
quickly capitalized on the vulnerability 
of the abandoned territory.
The inhabitants of Britain fought 
fiercely against the invaders
through several centuries of turmoil.
There are hardly any written records 
from this time,
so it’s difficult to reconstruct 
an accurate history.
However, surviving poetry from the era
gives us some clues.
One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur,
though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it.
It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur,
was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur.
That’s not much to go on,
but whoever this Arthur was,
he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors.
Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear.

Despite this uncertainty,
references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian
hundreds of years later.
In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
was a lowly cleric with grand ambitions.
Using Celtic and Latin sources,
he spent years creating 
a lengthy chronicle
titled, "The History 
of the Kings of Britain."
The centerpiece 
of this tome was King Arthur.

History is a generous term 
for Geoffrey’s account.
Writing six hundred years after 
the Saxon invasions,
he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry
to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records.
A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur,
and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places.
But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds
with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery.
Geoffrey blended them all:
A magical sword called Caledfwlch
and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material,
so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus,
the Latin translation of Caledfwlch.
Geoffrey even added a wise
counselor named Merlin,
based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, 
to Arthur’s story.
If Arthur did live, he would likely 
have been a military leader,
but a castle-bound king better fit
Geoffrey’s regal history.

Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention 
he’d hoped for,
and was soon translated from Latin
into French
by the poet Wace around 1155 CE.
Wace added another centerpiece of
Arthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword,
castle,
and wizard:
the Round Table.
He wrote that Arthur 
had the table constructed
so that all guests in his court 
would be equally placed,
and none could boast that he had 
the highest position at the table.
After reading Wace’s translation, 
another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes,
wrote a series of romances 
that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame.
He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain,
and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures.
He conceived Arthur,
Lancelot,
and Guinevere’s love triangle.
In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail.
Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology.
He lived in the middle of the Crusades,
and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail,
casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion.

Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages
followed from Chrétien’s work.
In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot,
and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur.
In the 15th century,
Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur,
the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur.

In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem,
his story has transformed over 
and over
to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences.
And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today.
Whether or not the man ever lived,
loved,
reigned,
or adventured,
it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.
